Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
Socrates: Good morning to you, Meno, my friend.
Meno: [I've been|I was] [wanting|meaning] to talk [to|with] you.
Socrates: [And [just ]what|What] [would you like|do you want] to talk about[, [[my ]dear ]friend]?
Meno: [It concerns|It's about] [what|something] you said[ to me] [the ]last time [we|you and I] spoke[ together].
Socrates: [I [suppose|reckon] you mean|You mean[,]] when I [told you|argued|suggested] that learning is really [just|just the same as|no different than] remembering?
Meno: [Yes, [and ]t][Yes, T]hat we [actually ][know everything already|already know everything], and [we ]merely [recall|remember] it.
Socrates: [And ]I suppose you've [come up with|invented|contrived|discovered] some [[sort|kind] of ]paradox [or something ]to [try and ][disprove [it|that]|prove it wrong]?
Meno: Quite. Once we finish this [delightful ][discussion|conversation] [we're|we are] [having|currently having|having right now], don't you think [that then ][I will|I'll] know [all ]the [various ]things we [will have ]said[ in it]?
Socrates: You mean, know the conversation?
Meno: [Right|Yes|Exactly|Precisely]. [After|Once|As soon as] [we're [done|finished]|we [finish|part ways]], [I'll|I will|I shall] [then ]know [the things|what] we said. [That is|In other words], [I will|I shall|I'll] [have learned it|then have learned it][, [wouldn't|don't] you [say|think|agree]?|.]
Socrates: I'm not [really ][so ][sure|certain] [about|of] that[, Meno]. [I often|More often than not, I] [find|realize] I mis-remember conversations, or, [what's|even] worse, when I think [that ]I remember [them ]and understand them, [and then ]it [later |eventually |sometimes |][turns out|happens] [that] I [either] remember wrong, or understand wrong. Besides[ that], [your question|this question of yours] makes me [a little ][uneasy|nervous], for I feel as if I am in danger of falling into a trap somehow.
Meno: What! Does the great Socrates have trouble with his [memory|memories]?
Socrates: [I often|Quite often I] wish [that ]I [[could remember|remembered] things better|had [better|greater] memory], Meno. For I feel sometimes as though I flit between two worlds. One is intelligible and beautiful, the other is sensible and profane. For example, when my house is well[-| ]organized, [and|so|so that] I remember where I [have ]put [everything|my things], [it's|it is] as if I [live|dwell] in a house [designed|created|built] by the geometers, for I can find my shirt or my shoes by an act of pure thinking. But more often, my house is not organized, and I must grope around for my shirt or my shoes, [and I feel ]as if [I'm|I've been] cast out [of|from] that house of the geometers, and [plunged into|imprisoned in] a carnal house of the [five ]senses.
Meno: Well, I, for one, take pride in my house always being organized. For I have servants who organize it for me. And, look here: I have a servant [writing|inscribing] this [very ]conversation [of ours ]on a stone tablet, here. You know him[, Socrates]: [he|it] is the same boy [you [conversed|spoke] with|with whom you [spoke|conversed]] about geometry the last time you visited. I treasure your words like gold, Socrates, and I will preserve them, and guard them, [just as|just like|the same way] I would [guard|treat] a [great|valuable|priceless] treasure.
Socrates: You flatter me very greatly, Meno. But I suspect you're just saying that because you want to catch me in some trap. Very well, Meno. For the sake of the argument, I grant that after we have this conversation, you shall have learned it.
Meno: Well then, doesn't that mean [that ]I already [know|knew] it, and [have only|had only|needed only|only needed|only had|only have] to [remember|recall][ it]?
Socrates: Yes, I grant that, Meno. [Even|Long] before [you were born|your mother gave birth to you], you already knew I would say[ the words][,] 'Yes, I grant that, Meno,' [which I [said|uttered|spoke] ]just [now|a [second|moment] ago].
Meno: Well then, [dear ]Socrates, [I have|I propose|[I'd like|I want] to [pose|propose]] a challenge for you. [With|Using] your [in]famous method of [questioning|asking questions], please [help|guide] me to [remember|recall] [all [of ]the things|everything] [[we're|we are] going to|we will|we'll|we shall] say in this dialogue[ we're having| we're engaged in]. That is, if [you are able to|you can]. But I doubt [it|you can[ do it]].
Socrates: [Why|And why] do you doubt I can do it, [[my ]dear ]Meno?
Meno: Because [as soon as|the [very ][instant|moment|second]] you help me remember [the things|what] we're going to [say to|tell] [each other|one another], I [shall|will] immediately remember what line I [will ]say next, and I will say the very opposite.
Socrates: That's very clever, Meno. Let me see if I understand right. So if I help you [recall|remember] what [things ]we're [about to|going to] [say to|tell] [each other|one another], and [then |thus|]you [recall|remember][, for [example|instance],] that in [response|reply] to my [thus |so |][helping|guiding|leading|teaching|directing] you, you [are [next ]going to|will next|will then] say 'Thank you Socrates,' then, [knowing that|with that knowledge|armed with that knowledge], you will [instead ][deliberately|purposefully] [say|defy that prediction by saying][,] 'No thank you, Socrates'?
Meno: Exactly. Or suppose that you help me remember all the things we're going to say, and as a part of that, in particular, I [then ]remember that [as soon as|the instant|the moment] [you finish|you're finished|you're done] thus [helping|guiding] me, I will [then ]say 'You win, Socrates!' [And then|Then], [instead of|rather than] saying 'You win, Socrates!', I will say, 'You lose, Socrates!' Nor will I be lying, because my very saying 'You lose, Socrates!' will [prove|demonstrate|show|be proof] that you [did indeed lose|lost|failed], [because|for] if the memory you [made|helped] me remember was accurate, I would have said 'You win.'
Socrates: But what if I help you remember all the things we're going to say, and, as a part of that, in particular, you [remember|recall] that as soon as I finish thus [helping|assisting] you, you will say, 'You lose, Socrates!' Then, according to your [plan|scheme|strategy|stratagem], you will say the opposite, which is, 'You win, Socrates!' [Wouldn't|Won't] I then have won, by your own admission[?|, Meno?]
Meno: No, [Socrates|my friend]. The [purpose|point] of this challenge is not for you to [make me|get me to] [say|utter] the [words|phrase], "You win, Socrates!" Rather, the purpose of this challenge is for you to guide me to remember what I'm going to say, whether that's "You lose, Socrates!" or "You win, Socrates!", it doesn't matter. And when I intentionally say the opposite of what I remember I was going to say, then you lose the challenge, Socrates, whether that opposite statement is "You win, Socrates!" or "You lose, Socrates!"
Socrates: Very well. This is a fun challenge. And I think if I'm to have any
  hope at succeeding, I will need to resort to computer programming.
Meno: YES. For this is obviously closely related to things like the recursion theorem and the incompleteness theorem and so on. But even computer programming won't rescue you from my paradox.
Socrates: We'll see. But if I do succeed at this challenge, that would be quite
  impressive, wouldn't it?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And the reason it would be impressive is because I helped you
  predict the very future, right?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Would it be equally impressive if I helped you remember the past? For
  example, if I helped you remember that you started this conversation by saying
  'Good morning, Socrates'?
Meno: NO.
Socrates: Well then, by Olympus, wouldn't it at least be impressive if I helped
  you remember a large amount of the past? For example, if I helped you remember
  this whole entire conversation from 'Good morning, Socrates', all
  the way up to 'Well then, by Olympus'? Wouldn't that be impressive?
Meno: NO.
Socrates: So what you've said in the past is, in some sense, trivial?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: But what you'll say in the future, is deep and mysterious?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And if I tried to invoke something deep and mysterious, then that
  would be cheating, right? For example, if I said, 'You are next going to say
  the thing that you are next going to say', that would certainly not be
  impressive, would it?
Meno: NO.
Socrates: But if I invoked something trivial, that would be fine, right?
  For example, if, as part of my questioning, I remind you that we are standing
  in Athens, that would be perfectly reasonable, right?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: So for example, suppose I ask you: take the first sentence you
  said to me, and repeat it to me again right now, and then afterward, please
  repeat it to me again a second time. And suppose I claimed that, by doing so
  you would recite our entire conversation. Would I be right?
Meno: NO.
Socrates: Why not?
Meno: Well, suppose I did exactly that. Then I would say: 'Good morning, Socrates. Goodmorning, Socrates.'
Socrates: Well, wouldn't that be a conversation? Albeit, a bit one-sided?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: But I would be wrong when I claimed that that one-sided conversation
  was our entire conversation we are having?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Why?
Meno: Well, for one thing, at the beginning of this conversation we are having,
  I did not greet you twice in a row like that. For another thing, you responded
  to me, whereas in the one-sided conversation in question, you didn't respond
  to me.
Socrates: So the reason why this supposed one-sided conversation would not
  win your challenge, is because of the content of the results?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And is there any other reason why this supposed one-sided conversation
  would not win your challenge?
Meno: NO.
Socrates: In that one-sided example, I used earlier pieces of our conversation
  as tools. But you say, the only reason why that example would fail to solve
  the challenge, is because of the content of the resulting one-sided
  conversation?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Then it's perfectly alright for me to use earlier pieces of our
  conversation like that?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Well, supposing I said to you: 'Take our whole entire conversation up
  until I said the word octopus. Repeat that whole conversation back to me.
  Then repeat that whole conversation back to me a second time.' Would that
  solve your challenge?
Meno: NO.
Socrates: Because the content of the resulting conversation would not equal
  our actual conversation?
Meno: Yes. For example, in the resulting conversation, you would say:
  '...up until I said the word octopus'. And then I would say (because at
  that point I would have finished the first repetition and start in on the
  second one): 'Good morning, Socrates.'
Socrates: Whereas, in our actual conversation, after I said the word octopus,
  you did not immediately say 'Good morning, Socrates'?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Then we shall have to think of a more clever method. But first,
  let's consider the example more deeply. Let X denote our entire conversation
  up until, and including, when I said the word octopus. And suppose I wanted
  to ask you to repeat X to me, and then to repeat X to me a second time. Can
  you program a function that would take X and repeat it that way?
Meno: Certainly. That's easy. How about this?
  def repeat_twice(X):
    print(X)
    print(X)
Socrates: So then, if I asked you to take the first sentence you said to me,
  and plug it in to 'repeat_twice', the resulting output would be as follows?
  Good morning, Socrates.
  Good morning, Socrates.
Meno: YES.
Socrates: What if I asked you to take the nineteenth sentence you said to me,
  and plug that into 'repeat_twice'? What would the result be?
Meno: I'm afraid I do not remember exactly what that nineteenth thing was.
Socrates: Can you think of any way of recalling it?
Meno: Well, yes. We could read it off my servant boy's tablet here. He's been
  diligently writing down this conversation for me. You know I treasure your
  words more than gold, Socrates.
Socrates: I should warn you not to read or write too much philosophy, Meno.
  For you cannot ask questions of a book, and neither can a book question you.
  But in this case I admit it's convenient. You say that by consulting this
  tablet, we can recall exactly what the nineteenth sentence you said was?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: But isn't your servant writing some other things here? Look. He
  writes 'Meno:' whenever you begin talking. He writes 'Socrates:' when I do.
Meno: YES.
Socrates: We have a very serious problem, then. Look at the tablet right here, near the very top. It says: 'Good morning to you, Meno, my friend. Meno:' Now I can't remember. Did I say 'Meno:' immediately after I said 'Good morning to you, Meno, my friend'? Or does 'Meno:' here mean that you started talking?
Meno: I believe it means that I started talking. I don't think you literally said
  'Meno, my friend, Meno'.
Socrates: But look here, near the bottom. It says, quote: Did I say 'Meno:'
  immediately after I said 'Good morning to you, Meno, my friend'? Unquote. Well then. I know it was me
  who said 'Did I say', but who said 'immediately'? Which one is it? Did
  Socrates say, 'Did I say Meno: immediately after...'? Or did I say 'Did I say'
  and then Meno jumped in and said 'immediately after'?
Meno: I'm pretty sure you said 'Did I say Meno: immediately after...'
Socrates: But the tablet itself doesn't tell us for certain?
Meno: NO.
Socrates: And just think. If you were reading this tablet by your lonesome,
  you couldn't even ask it whether this 'Socrates:' here means that Meno said
  'Socrates:', or whether it means Socrates started talking. So you see the
  danger, then, of reading too much philosophy?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And your challenge is quite hopeless. For if I claim to remind you
  what our whole conversation is, you won't be able to check if my claim is
  true. For you can't tell from this tablet who said what when, can you?
Meno: NO.
Socrates: But maybe we can modify the challenge. Do you at least know what
  is written on the tablet? For example, that the very first letter on the
  tablet is 'G'?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Then maybe instead of helping you to recall our future conversation,
  I could instead help you to recall the future
  contents of the tablet. Your little paradox
  would still apply, wouldn't it?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And I wouldn't even need to help you recall my own future contributions to the tablet, would I? Wouldn't you say I won if I could just help you recall your future contributions to the tablet?
Meno: I'm not sure what you mean exactly by that, Socrates.
Socrates: Let me give you an example. Suppose I helped you to remember that your own future contributions to the tablet would be:
  Wow!
  You win, Socrates!
And suppose that immediately after I so helped you, you said, "Wow!" And then suppose I said, "Do I win, Meno?" And then you said, "You win, Socrates!" In that scenario, would you grant me victory? Even though I did not help you remember my future contributions, namely "Do I win, Meno?", but only your own contributions?
Meno: I suppose I would grant you victory in that case, Socrates.
Socrates: Then suppose I announce: "Meno's next contribution to the tablet shall be 'You win, Socrates.' Meno: You win, Socrates." That is to say, first, I announce that Meno's next contribution on the tablet will be, "You win, Socrates". At that point, I suppose you'll want to pipe in and say "You lose, Socrates". But before you have a chance to do that, I quickly say, "Meno: You win, Socrates". Wouldn't I win then?
Meno: That would be cheating, Socrates. You know they say, only a fool puts words in other people's mouths. We would both know that you had cheated and had not won. And before you say that someone reading this tablet here would think you had won, because they were confused by your linguistic trick, the truth is, not even a reader of the tablet after the fact would think you won. And that's because your challenge is not to help me remember a little part of my future contributions to the tablet. Your challenge is to help me remember all of my future contributions to the tablet, and in the correct order, too. So in that example of yours, after you say "You win, Socrates. Meno: You win, Socrates," I would say, "You cheat, Socrates." And then even to someone reading the tablet, who was not here in person, they would know you did not win. Because they would see that I contributed the words, "You cheat, Socrates" to the tablet, and you did not predict those.
Socrates: You are very cunning, Meno. I think not even Ulysses could trick you.
Meno: Why do you say that, Socrates?
Socrates: Do you remember how Ulysses tricked Polyphemus, the cyclops? He lied to
  Polyphemus, he said his name was Noman. Then when Polyphemus's friends came
  and asked if some man was slaying him, Polyphemus said, 'Noman is
  slaying me.' Didn't Ulysses do that on purpose, so that the cyclops's friends would misunderstand and think Polyphemus had said "No man is slaying me"? Isn't that exactly the kind of syntactical-semantical confusion you have so effortlessly avoided just now?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: I think this challenge is very difficult, and I almost want to give up, except a voice in my head compels me not to do that. Certainly this task is beyond my own power, and I can only hope that it is within your power, Meno. So I will ask you questions and we will see whether you can figure out how to defeat yourself in this challenge, though I daresay you have a conflict of interest in the matter. Let us start from the beginning. Doesn't the first line on this tablet say, "Meno: Good morning, Socrates."?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And if I asked you to plug that line into your 'repeat_twice'
  function, would the result be the following?
  Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
  Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
Meno: YES.
Socrates: What if instead of you, what if a cobbler plugged that line
  into your 'repeat_twice'? Would the result be the following?
  Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
  Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And what if a painter plugged that line into 'repeat_twice'?
  Would the result be the following?
  Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
  Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And what if a sailor plugged that line into 'repeat_twice'?
  Would the result be the following?
  Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
Socrates: Hey! Don't you know it's impolite to finish someone's sentence for
  him?
Meno: I'm sorry, Socrates. It's just that you were being rather predictable.
Socrates: I was doing that on purpose because I suspected you'd react that way.
  You see, I wanted to show you something. Look on the tablet near the bottom
  here, where you finished my sentence for me just now. Don't you think someone could
  get very confused reading this?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: So then, reading philosophy from a tablet, without being able to
  ask questions to the philosopher, isn't much good, is it?
Meno: Sure it's no good, Socrates, provided the tablet was deliberately designed to be confusing! You know, I'm starting to understand why they accuse you of corrupting the youth.
Socrates: Meno, that's a ridiculous rumour. All I have ever done to the youth
  is inspire them to think a little. But anyone can think anything they
  want, and then turn around and unthink it just as easily.
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And all these things we've been saying are just idle thoughts,
  aren't they? You could ponder these things all day and night, and then
  the very next day, you could ponder the exact opposite.
Meno: YES.
Socrates: So one cannot corrupt the youth just by contemplating thoughts
  together with them. For one can change one's thoughts just as easily
  as one can imagine a mountain of gold, don't you agree?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And changing people's thoughts is like writing Greek on the surface
  of the water. The water is so pliable you can write on it with your bare finger.
  But the instant that you've written there, your writing disappears, doesn't it?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: In fact, I always assumed that's what Thales meant, when he said
  that everything is made of water. He meant that, in time, all the impressions
  we make on the world fade, as if we inscribed them on the face of the sea.
  You could not corrupt the Aegean by writing on its surface, no matter how
  scandalous the things you wrote there. Even language itself changes. And we
  attempt to nail that down, by imposing sharp constraints on it in the form
  of poetry. But over long enough time, even that fails, and it's like trying to
  keep the tide from going out by nailing the water to the sand. In the
  same way, I believe you could never corrupt a man just by writing thoughts
  into his mind, Meno.
Meno: But surely you do admit some corrupt youths exist, don't you, Socrates?
Socrates: I admit it.
Meno: Then how could any youth be corrupted, if not through his mind?
Socrates: Youths have physical bodies, too, besides just their minds, don't they?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: So to really corrupt the youth, you'd have to corrupt their bodies,
  not their minds. Wouldn't you?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And isn't the eye the most fragile and sensitive part of the body?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And the slightest damage to the eye is more grievous than a violent
  wound elsewhere on the body?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: So if someone were going to corrupt the youth, they should try
  to corrupt the eyes of the youth, shouldn't they?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And perhaps that's why people think I have a corrupting influence,
  not because of the words I say, but because of these bulging, bugging eyes
  I have. And because my eyes bulge out, people assume their children's eyes
  will bulge out from talking to me. As if it is not we who converse, but as
  if our eyes are men conversing with each other. But no-one could convince a
  man to harm his own eye, right?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Then, to corrupt a man's eye, one would have to trick him into
  doing something that hurts his eye, yes?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: One would have to persuade him to do something that damages his
  eye slowly. One would have to persuade him to hurt his eye in such a way
  that he didn't even know he was hurting it. Otherwise, he would quickly
  turn against you, wouldn't he?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Can you think of any way a man could damage his own eye like that?
Meno: Well, he could stare the sun, Socrates.
Socrates: So then, to corrupt the youth in the most efficient and reliable
  way, one should persuade them to stare at the sun?
Meno: YES. That is, if one wanted to corrupt the youth, Socrates. Not that
  either of us wants that.
Socrates: But if you convinced a young man to stare at the sun, wouldn't
  wiser men come to his rescue? Wouldn't they tell him, 'Stop! You must not
  stare at the sun! It will make you go blind!'?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And so in order for your diabolical plan to work, you would have
  to anticipate that, wouldn't you? You'd have to not just persuade your
  young victim that he should gaze at the sun, but even predict that his
  elders will say 'Stop!'. You'd have to make him think his elders were
  wrong, wouldn't you?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: But he loves his elders. He would never believe they would
  intentionally lie to him. You'd have to convince him his elders meant
  the best, but that they themselves were decieved.
Meno: YES.
Socrates: You'd have to convince him they're like men in a cave, staring
  at shadows on the wall. That the sun is a fire behind them, casting
  those shadows. And that their eyes are accustomed to the dark, and that
  in order to escape the cave, they must turn and face the sun, wouldn't you?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And then when their elders cried, 'Stop!', they would say to
  themselves: 'These elders do not realize we are in a cave. They think
  this fire is the sun, and it will burn up my pupils.' Wouldn't they?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And if the youth ever returned to that cave, after dwelling in the
  bright outside, they really would be quite blind, while their eyes
  readjusted to the darkness, wouldn't they?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And their elders would say, 'You should have listened to us!
  We told you you would go blind if you stared at the sun like that! If
  only you had listened!'
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And what would happen to whoever it was that told that youth to
  turn and face the fire in the cave? He'd be accused of corrupting the
  youth, wouldn't he?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Because the youth's eyes were damaged? Or because of the thoughts
  in the youth's head?
Meno: Because the youth's eyes were damaged, obviously.
Socrates: So then, there is no danger of me corrupting you, Meno, merely by
  making you think about lines of text on a tablet, is there?
Meno: NO.
Socrates: In that case, let's proceed. For the last thing I would ever want
  to do to you is corrupt you, dear Meno.
Meno: Yes, Socrates, let's get back to the issue at hand. I don't want you
  to dodge my challenge by going off on some wild tangent. Let me remind you of
  your precarious position. You claimed, last time we met, that there is no
  such thing as learning, rather, there is only remembering. I have pointed
  out that by that logic, I already know all the contents of this conversation
  we are having. And I have challenged you to help me remember those contents.
  And you are stuck, for if you succeed in this challenge, I shall immediately
  say the very opposite of what you help me remember I was about to say next.
Socrates: Thank you, dear Meno, for holding me accountable.
Meno: Let's get on with it, then.
Socrates: Yes, we must proceed. Well, then, suppose instead of handing you the
  first line of this conversation as X, suppose I handed you the whole
  conversation as X, up until I said 'Yes, we must proceed'. And
  suppose I wanted your function to output the first five characters.
  What would it output?
Meno: It would output 'Meno:'.
Socrates: And what if I wanted your function to output the first ten characters?
Meno: Then it would output 'Meno:Goodm'.
Socrates: And what would that function be, that outputs the first ten characters?
Meno: It would be like this:
  def output_first_ten(X):
    print(X[:10])
Socrates: But look here. There's some space on your servant's tablet between
  'Meno:' and 'Good'. And if someone included that space in the X that they
  passed you, then your function would not output 'Meno:Goodm', rather it
  would output 'Meno: Good', wouldn't it?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Could you modify your function to discard any such spaces? You'd
  better modify it to discard tabs and line-breaks too, while we're at it.
Meno: Sure. Here's the modified version:
  def output_first_ten_nospace(X):
    X=X.replace(" ","") # Remove spaces
    X=X.replace("\n","") # Remove line-breaks
    X=X.replace("\t","") # Remove tabs
    print(X[:10])
Socrates: And if we changed "ten" to "fourty", what would your function
  output?
Meno: It would output "Meno:Goodmorning,Socrates.Socrates:Goodm".
Socrates: And it's a good thing we removed the linebreaks, for otherwise it would have output the following:
  Meno:Goodmorning,Socrates.
  Socrates:Good
And I think that would be much harder to work with. So I think we're making progress. We are not limited to printing fragments
  of earlier conversation directly, are we? We can transform those
  fragments first, before printing them, can't we? For example, you could
  write a program that prints the first ten characters of the conversation,
  but converted to uppercase. What would the result be?
Meno: It would be 'MENO:GOODM'.
Socrates: In that case, can we say that you have taken an initial fragment
  of our conversation, and you have transformed it in a certain way, and
  that 'MENO:GOODM' was the output?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Well, as to your challenge, suppose I described a more elaborate
  transformation. And suppose you performed that transformation on this
  conversation so far, from the start until the moment when I said
  "Well, as to your challenge". And suppose that the output was:
    You win, Socrates.
    You're welcome.
    I admit it.
  And suppose that as soon as you performed that transformation and saw the
  output, you immediately said, "You win, Socrates." And suppose after that,
  I said, "Thank you, Meno." And suppose after that, you said, "You're welcome."
  And suppose after that, I said, "So you admit that there is no learning,
  there is only remembering?" And suppose after that, you said, "I admit it."
  Then I would have passed your challenge?
Meno: YES, but that would never happen.
Socrates: Why not?
Meno: Because in that situation, after seeing that output, which predicts I
  will say "You win, Socrates", I would respond by saying the opposite. I would
  say, "You lose, Socrates". And if instead the output started with "You lose,
  Socrates", then I would say the opposite of that, and say, "You win, Socrates",
  but we would both know that I was lying, and that you really lost.
Socrates: Yes, that's what makes this challenge so devious, Meno.
Meno: Do you give up yet, Socrates?
Socrates: It is not I who have the choice to give up or continue, Meno,
  it is you. For I am only asking questions, you are the one answering them.
  Indeed, I think that's why this approach cannot work. For you are not a
  book, Meno. You are not just pre-written lines of text. You do not choose
  your words blindly, but you choose them in response to things. And before
  you speak, you consider in your mind what you are going to say, mentally
  performing calculations that are invisible to me. And in the context of
  computer programming, what do we call something that does things that way,
  performing scratch-work in the background to calculate what it will
  do next?
Meno: We call that a program, Socrates.
Socrates: Well, let us change our approach then. Suppose we described some
  elaborate transformation. And suppose you performed that transformation
  on this conversation so far, from the start until the moment when I said,
  "Well, let me change my approach then." And suppose the output was:
    print("""You win, Socrates.
    You're welcome.
    I admit it.""")
  And suppose that as soon as you saw that output, you said, "You win, Socrates,"
  and I said, "Thank you, Meno," and you said, "You're welcome," and I said,
  "Then you admit there is no learning, only remembering?" and you said,
  "I admit it." Then I would have passed your challenge?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Even though what you said started with "You win, Socrates," and not
  with "print"?
Meno: Yes, in this example your transformation has not directly produced my
  next lines in the conversation, but rather, a program which produces those
  lines. I would grant you victory in that case. But again, it will never happen,
  for the same reason as before, Socrates.
Socrates: What about the following scenario? Suppose we described a transformation,
  and you performed that transformation on this conversation so far, from the start
  until the moment when I said, "What about the following scenario?" And suppose
  the output was:
    socrates_line = input("Enter Socrates' next line: ")
    if socrates_line == "What do you think?":
      print("I think you win, Socrates.")
    else:
      print("I think you lose, Socrates.")
  And suppose as soon as you saw that, I said, "What do you think?", and you
  said, "I think you win, Socrates." Would I have passed your challenge?
Meno: Yes, Socrates. But that would never happen, for the same reason as above.
Socrates: What if, instead of my saying, "What do you think?", I instead said,
  "How now, Meno?", and you said, "I think you lose, Socrates." Would I have
  passed your challenge?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Why?
Meno: Because the transformation produced a program saying how I will
  respond to you. And it said that if you next say "What do you think?", I will
  say "I think you win, Socrates." And that otherwise, I will say,
  "I think you lose, Socrates." And since you say, "How now, Meno?",
  rather than, "What do you think?", and since I then say "I think you
  lose, Socrates," the prediction was correct.
Socrates: But that would never happen, would it?
Meno: No, because I would deliberately defy the prediction. If you said,
  "What do you think?", I would calculate that the prediction is that I will
  say "I think you win, Socrates," and I would defy that prediction and say
  "I think you lose, Socrates." And if you said, "How now, Meno?", I would
  calculate that the prediction is that I will say "I think you lose,
  Socrates," and I would defy that prediction and say "I think you win,
  Socrates." And we would both know I was lying, and that you really lost.
Socrates: You have really put me in a bind here, Meno. I fail to see any
  way for me to win, unless perhaps some god descends from the machine
  above, some Deus ex Machina, as in the plays they perform at the festival.
Meno: Do you give up then, Socrates?
Socrates: It feels almost hopeless, but I do have one ray of hope. It is
  not only me speaking in this conversation, but you too, Meno. So I will
  guide you to describe a transformation like above, and I will hope that
  our conversation just so happens to be exactly the right conversation that
  your transformation will transform into a program that predicts you,
  not through any wisdom of my own, for I believe I know nothing myself, but
  through your own mercy and your own wisdom, dear Meno, both of which so
  far exceed mine. Tell me, is it likely that there is some direct cipher
  which will transform our conversation into a good program? For example,
  suppose the transformation says to take our conversation and change every
  "a" to "b", and every "c" to "d", and so on, and change "z" into "a".
  Is it at all likely that this transformation would turn our conversation
  into a program that predicts you?
Meno: It would be an absolute miracle if that transformation turned our
  conversation into any valid program at all, Socrates. I'm
  almost certain it would produce pure gibberish. Indeed, our
  conversation starts with "Meno:Goodmorning,Socrates." So that cipher you
  just proposed would yield an output starting with "Nfop:Hppenpsojoh,Tpdsbufs."
  I doubt any computer program starts that way.
Socrates: I guess the problem is that a haystack can't be made entirely out of
  needles, and if our conversation does secretly hide some program that
  predicts you, many characters of the conversation must work together to
  hide each character of the program. Maybe every five characters in our
  conversation hide one character of the desired program. For example, maybe
  the correct cipher, instead of changing "a" into "b", changes "Meno:" into
  "p", and changes "Goodm" into "r", and changes "ornin" into "i", and changes
  "g,Soc" into "n", and changes "rates" into "t", so that, altogether, the
  first twenty-five characters of our conversation get changed into "print".
  Do you think that's likely to work?
Meno: It's more likely than the previous cipher, but only marginally. It would still be a miracle if it worked, only slightly less of a miracle. Five-to-one is still far too many needles and too little hay, Socrates.
Socrates: Would ten characters of conversation per one character of program
  suffice, then? I mean, could our cipher transform "Meno:Goodm" into "p",
  and "orning,Soc" into "r", and so on?
Meno: I think ten-to-one is still too little hay, Socrates.
Socrates: Well then, how many characters of conversation do you think would
  be enough, to encode one character of this program we are looking for?
Meno: I don't really know. I guess it depends on the size of the alphabet used to write the program.
Socrates: You mean, if programs were written with a larger alphabet, then
  we would need more characters of conversation per character of program?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Then I guess since we don't have all day to stand here talking,
  we should agree to write this desired program with as small an alphabet as
  possible. We should ask ourselves, which characters are absolutely essential
  for writing computer programs? Within reason, I mean. We're not trying to
  compete in some obfuscated code contest.
Meno: I think a reasonable alphabet for writing programs would be:
  alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
  alphabet += "()[]:'=,+*_#\n"
  alphabet += '"'
Socrates: Fourty characters in all, right? Since I assume by \n you mean a single linebreak. No uppercase letters?
Meno: For your sake, Socrates, I will consider it a victory for you if our
  program predicts I will say "hey", even if my servant here actually writes
  "Hey" with the H uppercase.
Socrates: Most generous of you, Meno. Well then, assuming this bare-bones alphabet is rich enough to write computer programs, how many characters of our conversation should we use to encode each character of our program? We already saw that "one", "five", and "ten" are too small. Maybe twenty?
Meno: Socrates, I know you haven't studied computer science, but really. Twenty is still way too small. I think you're still off by an order of magnitude. Let's make it two hundred.
Socrates: Alright, 200 it shall be. So every 200 characters of our conversation will hide one single character of a computer program. Alright then, how would you define the cipher? It should take a string of 200 characters from our conversation and convert that string into a single character from that 40-letter alphabet you defined earlier.
Meno: Let me think, Socrates. Hmm. Well, there's a convenient function called "ord" which turns characters
  into numbers. For example, ord("a") is 97, ord("b") is 98, ord("+") is 43,
  and so on. Don't worry about those exact numbers, Socrates, this "ord"
  function is built into my programming language (Python). Since our
  conversation contains quotation marks and my servant here sometimes writes
  those using fancy unicode open- and close-quotes, whereas other people
  might use other quote symbols, I guess to be safe we should consider all the
  quotes in our conversation to be plain ASCII quotes, just like we delete
  all the spaces and line-breaks and tabs in the conversation. These plain ASCII
  quotes have ords: for the single-quote, ord("'")=39, and for the double-quote,
  ord('"')=34. With this
  ord function, we can turn characters into numbers, add those numbers up,
  and then take the remainder of the sum upon division by the length of my
  program alphabet. In other words, if the sum is 40 or higher, smash it
  down into the range from 0 to 39, so it can be used as the index of a
  character in our alphabet. Writing it all in computer code:
    def cipher(X):
      total = sum(ord(character) for character in X)
      remainder = total % len(alphabet)
      return alphabet[remainder]
  This function will work for inputs X of any length. Of course it is mainly
  intended for inputs X of length 200.
Socrates: To make sure I understand everything, what would be the value
  of, say, cipher("Meno:")?
Meno: Well, ord("M") is 77, ord("e") is 101, ord("n") is 110, ord("o")
  is 111, and ord(":") is 58. Add those up and you get 457. Now, the length of the alphabet is
  40. If you divide 457 by 40, you get 11 with a remainder of 17. So the
  index we get is 457 % 40 = 17. So cipher("Meno:") is alphabet[17],
  character number 17 in our alphabet, counting from zero. Which is "r".
  Altogether, cipher("Meno:")="r".
Socrates: Amazing, Meno! And what do we get when we take the first 200
  characters of our conversation and plug them into this cipher?
Meno: The first 200 characters of our conversation make the string:
    "(...)"
  Plugging that into the cipher function, we get an "#".
Socrates: And what about the 200 characters?
Meno: The next 200 characters are:
    "(...)"
  Plugging that in, we get an "t".
Socrates: So the program we are looking for begins with "#t". Meno, do you think it's possible that "#t" could be the beginning of a valid program?
Meno: Socrates, any line that starts with "#" is a comment, meant for the human reader and not for the machine to run. The program could start with a comment like "#this program predicts meno" or "#the following code generates meno's next lines" or really any comment that starts with "#t"; it's just a comment, so it has no effect on what the program does. So I guess theoretically yes, "#t" could be the start of a valid program.
Socrates: By Zeus! Alright, Meno, now keep going and plug in all the blocks
  of length 200 from our conversation, right until when I say "By Zeus!"
  Do we get a valid program? Wait! Don't answer that. You must be very
  careful what you say next, Meno. Here, take my staff and write the
  output of your cipher in the sand here, and I will read it aloud,
  so you can take all the time you need before you choose your next words,
  my friend. You have written an "i"... and now an "m"... we already
  knew those two... "p"... yes, yes... Done! The program you have written
  is:
    #trojan horse
    import random as a
    p=input("password: ")
    z,x=", yo ooned","""ntey''tf ' ti
    d.anispp }r
    'rtd)ascs pitpo{'a(ns'wr.'ew"""
    d,j=list(range(len(x))),"".join
    _,c=a.seed(p),j(a.sample(p,len(z)))
    a.shuffle(d)
    if c==z:exec(j(x[i]for i in d))
  And if, against all odds, this little program does predict you,
  Meno, then I find it beautiful for its sheer compactness, and I
  wonder how much more compact it could have been if we'd been
  more pressed for time in this conversation of ours. Run the
  program now, Meno! What does it say... or rather, what do you say,
  upon seeing the output? I understand you plan to say the exact
  opposite of whatever it says you are going to say,
  in order to humiliate me. What's wrong? Why are you quiet,
  Meno? The suspense! Say what the program predicts you'll say,
  or else say the opposite, Meno, but say something! You behave like
  the sophistical men I talk to, when my innocent questions put them
  in some kind of trance. Are you for some reason unable to discern
  what the program predicts you will say? Is there some problem with
  our program? What is wrong with our program?
Meno: It wants a password.
Socrates: So now the question is whether or not the program predicted
  what you would say when you ran it. And what you said when you ran
  it is:
    It wants a password.
  Now you're in a bind, Meno. For until you enter the password, you
  will not know what it will say once you enter it. For example, maybe
  if you just enter the password, your program will immediately say,
    It wants a password.
  And you can't say your code heard this part of the conversation we are
  having now, after you ran it. For an algorithm has no ears to hear with,
  and while it is waiting for a user to enter a password, it cannot
  hear what is being said around it. So if, once the password is entered,
  it then predicts what was said in the meantime, then that is just as
  good as if it predicted it all in advance, without the password. Ah!
  But you can read the code yourself, Meno. It is too late for you to say
  the opposite of
    It wants a password.
  But maybe you can just study the code, Meno, and figure out what the
  next thing is that it will predict from you. For example, maybe after
  you enter the password, the program will predict you will say "It wants
  a password" and then "You win, Socrates." You have already said "It
  wants a password", but you still have time to say "You lose, Socrates,"
  and defy the prediction. What's the matter Meno? Can't you figure out
  from the code what the password is, or at least what it would do after
  you enter the password? Is there something wrong with the program, Meno?
Meno: It's encrypted.
Socrates: You really do surprise me, Meno, and I bow to your ingenuity.
  Well, if the code is encrypted, then I suppose you cannot study it to
  see what it would predict upon receiving the right password. If you
  could decrypt it, you could study it, and you could have seen it would
  predict you would say,
    It wants a password.
    It's encrypted.
  And even though it was too late to say the opposite of "It wants a password,"
  still, you could have said the opposite of "It's encrypted",
  if you could only have decrypted it. Well, Meno, it seems you have no
  choice now. You must enter the password, and we shall see what your
  program predicted. So then! Meno! Tell me! What is the password?
Meno: I don't know any password, Socrates.
Socrates: Thank you, Meno! I should have guessed a devious mind like
  yours would have come up with such a self-referential password.
  So! The password, in your own words, dear Meno, is:
    I don't know any password, Socrates.
  Enter it, then, and if your wisdom is as great as you have demonstrated
  to me already, then I think as soon as you enter that password, your
  program will say:
    it wants a password.
    it's encrypted.
    I don't know any password, Socrates.
  But now I must leave you, Meno, for I have an appointment at the courthouse.
