Meno: [Hello|Ah|Oh], Socrates, how [nice|good] to see you. [I've been|I was] [wanting|meaning] to talk [to|with] you.
Socrates: [Hello! ][And [just ]what|What] [would you like|do you want] to talk about[, [[my ]dear ]Meno]?
Meno: [It concerns|It's about] [what|something] you said[ to me] [the ]last time [we|you and I] spoke.
Socrates: You mean, when I told you that learning is really just remembering?
Meno: Yes, that we actually know everything already, and merely remember it.
Socrates: I suppose you've come up with some paradox to try and disprove it?
Meno: Quite. Once we finish this conversation, don't you think I'll know it?
Socrates: You mean, know the conversation?
Meno: Yes. I will know what we said. In other words, I'll have learned it.
Socrates: Certainly. Just like just now, you learned I would say, 'Certainly'.
Meno: Well then, doesn't that mean I already know it, and have only to remember?
Socrates: Yes indeed, Meno. Even before you were born, you already knew I would
  say, 'Yes indeed, Meno', just now.
Meno: Well then, Socrates, I have a challenge for you. Using your famous method
  of asking questions, please help me to remember all the things we're going to
  say in this dialog. That is, if you can. But I doubt you can do it.
Socrates: And why do you doubt that, Meno?
Meno: Because as soon as you help me remember the things we're going to tell
  each other, I will immediately remember what line I say next, and I will say
  the very opposite.
Socrates: That's very clever, Meno. Let me see if I understand right. So if I
  help you remember what we're going to tell each other, and you remember that
  in response to my thus helping you, you are going to say 'Thank you Socrates',
  then, knowing that, you will deliberately say, 'No thank you, Socrates'?
Meno: Exactly. Or suppose that you help me remember all the things we're going
  to say, and as a part of that, in particular, I remember that as soon as you
  finish thus helping me, I will say 'You win, Socrates!' Then, instead of saying
  'You win, Socrates!', I will say, 'You lose, Socrates!'. Nor will I be lying,
  because my very saying 'You lose, Socrates!' will prove that you lost, because
  if the memory you made me remember was accurate, I would have said 'You win'.
Socrates: Very well. This is a fun challenge. And I think if I'm to have any
  hope at succeeding, I will need to resort to computer programming.
Meno: YES. For this is obviously closely related to things like Kleene's
  recursion theorem and so on. But even computer programming won't rescue you
  from my paradox.
Socrates: We'll see. But if I do succeed at this challenge, that would be quite
  impressive, wouldn't it?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And the reason you it would be impressive is because I helped you
  predict the very future, right?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Would it be equally impressive if I helped you remember the past? For
  example, if I helped you remember that you started this conversation by saying
  'Ah, Socrates, how nice to see you'?
Meno: NO.
Socrates: Well then, by Olympus, wouldn't it at least be impressive if I helped
  you remember a large amount of the past? For example, if I helped you remember
  this whole entire conversation from 'Ah, Socrates, how nice to see you', all
  the way up to 'Well then, by Olympus'? Wouldn't that be impressive?
Meno: NO.
Socrates: So what you've said in the past is, in some sense, trivial?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: But what you'll say in the future, is deep and mysterious?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And if I tried to invoke something deep and mysterious, then that
  would be cheating, right? For example, if I said, 'You are next going to say
  the thing that you are next going to say', that would certainly not be
  impressive, would it?
Meno: NO.
Socrates: But if I invoked something trivial, that would be fine, right?
  For example, if, as part of my questioning, I remind you that we are standing
  in Athens, that would be perfectly reasonable, right?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: So for example, suppose I ask you: take the first two sentences you
  said to me, and repeat them to me again right now, and then afterward, please
  repeat them to me again a second time. And suppose I claimed that, by doing so
  you would recite our entire conversation. Would I be right?
Meno: NO.
Socrates: Why not?
Meno: Well, suppose I did exactly that. Then I would say: 'Ah, Socrates, how
  nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you. Ah, Socrates, how
  nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.'
Socrates: Well, wouldn't that be a conversation? Albeit, a bit one-sided?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: But I would be wrong when I claimed that that one-sided conversation
  was our entire conversation we are having?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Why?
Meno: Well, for one thing, at the beginning of this conversation we are having,
  I did not greet you twice in a row like that. For another thing, you responded
  to me, whereas in the one-sided conversation in question, you didn't respond
  to me.
Socrates: So the reason why this supposed one-sided conversation would not
  win your challenge, is because of the content of the results?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And is there any other reason why this supposed one-sided conversation
  would not win your challenge?
Meno: NO.
Socrates: In that one-sided example, I used earlier pieces of our conversation
  as tools. But you say, the only reason why that example would fail to solve
  the challenge, is because of the content of the resulting one-sided
  conversation?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Then it's perfectly alright for me to use earlier pieces of our
  conversation like that?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Well, supposing I said to you: 'Take whole entire conversation up
  until I said the word octopus. Repeat that whole conversation back to me.
  Then repeat that whole conversation back to me a secon time.' Would that
  solve your challenge?
Meno: NO.
Socrates: Because the content of the resulting conversation would not equal
  our actual conversation?
Meno: Yes. For example, in the resulting conversation, you would say:
  '...up until I said the word octopus'. And then I would say (because at
  that point I would have finished the first repetition and start in on the
  second one): 'Ah, Socrates, how nice to meet you...'
Socrates: Whereas, in our actual conversation, after I said the word octopus,
  you did not immediately say 'Ah, Socrates, how nice to meet you'?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Then I shall have to think of a more clever method. But first,
  let's consider the example more deeply. Let X denote our entire conversation
  up until, and including, when I said the word octopus. And suppose I wanted
  to ask you to repeat X to me, and then to repeat X to me a second time. Can
  you program a function that would take X and repeat it that way?
Meno: Certainly. That's easy. How about this?
  def repeat_twice(X):
    print(X)
    print(X)
Socrates: So then, if I asked you to take the first sentence you said to me,
  and plug it in to 'repeat_twice', the resulting output would be as follows?
  Ah, Socrates, how nice to meet you.
  Ah, Socrates, how nice to meet you.
Meno: YES.
Socrates: What if I asked you to take the nineteenth sentence you said to me,
  and plug that into 'repeat_twice'? What would the result be?
Meno: I'm afraid I do not remember exactly what that nineteenth thing was.
Socrates: Can you think of any way of recalling it?
Meno: Well, yes. We could read it off my servant boy's tablet here. He's been
  diligently writing down this conversation for me. You know I treasure your
  words more than gold, Socrates.
Socrates: I should warn you not to read or write too much philosophy, Meno.
  For you cannot ask questions of a book, and neither can a book question you.
  But in this case I admit it's convenient. You say that by consulting this
  tablet, we can recall exactly what the nineteenth sentence you said was?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: But isn't your servant writing some other things here? Look. He
  writes 'Meno:' whenever you begin talking. He writes 'Socrates:' when I do.
Meno: YES.
Socrates: We have a very serious problem, then. Look at the tablet right here.
  It says: 'But what you'll say in the future, is deep and mysterious? Meno:'
  Now I can't remember. Did I say 'Meno:' immediately after I said 'mysterious'?
  Or does 'Meno:' here mean that you started talking?
Meno: I believe it means that I began talking. I don't think you literally said
  'mysterious Meno'.
Socrates: But look here, near the bottom. It says, quote: Did I say 'Meno:'
  immediately after I said 'mysterious'? Unquote. Well then. I know it was me
  who said 'Did I say', but who said 'immediately'? Which one is it? Did
  Socrates say, 'Did I say Meno: immediately after...'? Or did I say 'Did I say'
  and then Meno jumped in and said 'immediately after'?
Meno: I'm pretty sure you said 'Did I say Meno: immediately after...'
Socrates: But the tablet itself doesn't tell us for certain?
Meno: NO.
Socrates: And just think. If you were reading this tablet by your lonesome,
  you couldn't even ask it whether this 'Socrates:' here means that Meno said
  'Socrates:', or whether it means Socrates started talking. So you see the
  danger, then, of reading too much philosophy?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And your challenge is quite hopeless. For if I claim to remind you
  what our whole conversation is, you won't be able to check if my claim is
  true. For you can't tell from this tablet who said what when, can you?
Meno: NO.
Socrates: But maybe we can modify the challenge. Do you at least know what
  is written on the tablet? For example, that the very first letter on the
  tablet is 'M'?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Then maybe instead of helping you to recall our whole conversation
  (past, present, and future), I could instead help you to recall the whole
  contents of the tablet (past, present, and future). Your little paradox
  would still apply, wouldn't it?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: That is, as soon as I remind you of the whole contents of the
  tablet (past, present, and future), you could immediately say something
  not included in those contents, and thus deliberately prove me wrong?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Since we can't tell who said what when from our tablet, I think
  instead of talking about sentences or words on the tablet, we should talk
  about lines, and characters. Those make more sense, don't they?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And didn't Homer teach us the importance of distinguishing syntax
  from semantics like this?
Meno: What do you mean, Socrates?
Socrates: Isn't that how Ulysses fooled Polyphemus, the cyclops? He lied to
  Polyphemus, he said his name was Noman. So when Polyphemus's friends came
  and asked if some man was slaying him, he said, 'It is Noman that is
  slaying me.' Isn't that exactly the kind of confusion we must avoid, Meno?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: You challenged me to teach you to predict this very dialog. Don't
  you see now how unfair that is? Don't you see you should have challenged
  me to teach you to predict the lines, the spaces, the characters?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And the first line of the tablet is, 'Meno: Ah, Socrates, how nice
  to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.'?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And if I asked you to plug that line into your 'repeat_twice'
  function, would the result be the following?
  Meno: Ah, Socrates, how nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
  Meno: Ah, Socrates, how nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
Meno: YES.
Socrates: What if instead of you, what if a cobbler plugged that line
  into your 'repeat_twice'? Would the result be the following?
  Meno: Ah, Socrates, how nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
  Meno: Ah, Socrates, how nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And what if a painter plugged that line into 'repeat_twice'?
  Would the result be the following?
  Meno: Ah, Socrates, how nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
  Meno: Ah, Socrates, how nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And what if a sailor plugged that line into 'repeat_twice'?
  Would the result be the following?
  Meno: Ah, Socrates, how nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
Meno: Ah, Socrates, how nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
Socrates: Hey! Don't you know it's impolite to finish someone's sentence for
  him?
Meno: I'm sorry, Socrates. It's just that you were being rather predictable.
Socrates: I was doing that on purpose because I suspected you'd react that way.
  You see, I wanted to show you something. Look on the tablet near the bottom
  here, where you finished my sentence for me. Don't you think someone could
  get very confused reading this?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: So then, reading philosophy from a tablet, without being able to
  ask questions to the philosopher, isn't much good, is it?
Meno: NO.
Socrates: And in order to do philosophy right, you must be able to question
  your teacher?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And as I'm the one asking questions here, clearly you are the
  teacher, Meno, and I'm your student. Well then, I just created some
  confusion on that tablet when I tricked you into finishing my sentence
  for me. As my teacher, can you think of an even more confusing example?
Meno: What do you mean, Socrates?
Socrates: I had been uttering some lines just now that started with "Meno:".
  And when you anticipated me, you jumped in and finished my sentence for
  me. So if a reader wasn't paying close attention to these indents,
  they would have thought that the line when you anticipated me, was
  actually a line that I was uttering. Isn't that what introduced the
  confusion?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Well, now you try. Make me anticipate you and finish your thought
  for you. Except this time, let us make it more confusing. Instead of
  making me finish a line for you, make me finish a whole set of lines
  for you. Wouldn't that be even more confusing?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Well, go ahead then.
Meno: Alright, Socrates. Suppose that in our conversation here, we had
  said the following things:
    Socrates: And if I asked you to plug that line into your 'repeat_twice'
      function, would the result be the following?
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
    Meno: YES.
    Socrates: What if instead of you, what if a cobbler plugged that line
      into your 'repeat_twice'? Would the result be the following?
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
    Meno: YES.
    Socrates: And what if a painter plugged that line into 'repeat_twice'?
      Would the result be the following?
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
    Meno: YES.
    Socrates: And what if a sailor plugged that line into 'repeat_twice'?
      Would the result be the following?
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
    Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
  Then wouldn't you be upset at me, and react in the following way?
    Socrates: Hey! Don't you know it's impolite to finish someone's sentence?
Socrates: Certainly, Meno. There's no need to speculate idly. That's
  exactly how it happened, isn't it?
Meno: Alright, Socrates. But suppose that instead of philosophers, the two
  of us were cobblers. And suppose as cobblers, we had the following
  conversation together:
    Socrates: And if I asked you to plug that line into your 'repeat_twice'
      function, would the result be the following?
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
    Meno: YES.
    Socrates: What if instead of you, what if a cobbler plugged that line
      into your 'repeat_twice'? Would the result be the following?
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
    Meno: YES.
    Socrates: And what if a painter plugged that line into 'repeat_twice'?
      Would the result be the following?
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
    Meno: YES.
    Socrates: And what if a sailor plugged that line into 'repeat_twice'?
      Would the result be the following?
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
    Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
  Then wouldn't you be upset at me, and react in the following way?
    Socrates: Hey! Don't you know it's impolite to finish someone's sentence?
Socrates: Certainly. For, in my opinion, there's no real difference between
  a philosopher and a cobbler, really. After all, what else does a philosopher
  do besides help people get their feet on the ground?
Meno: A very good point, Socrates. But suppose that instead of philosophers,
  the two of us were painters. And suppose as painters, we had the following
  conversation together:
    Socrates: And if I asked you to plug that line into your 'repeat_twice'
      function, would the result be the following?
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
    Meno: YES.
    Socrates: What if instead of you, what if a cobbler plugged that line
      into your 'repeat_twice'? Would the result be the following?
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
    Meno: YES.
    Socrates: And what if a painter plugged that line into 'repeat_twice'?
      Would the result be the following?
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
    Meno: YES.
    Socrates: And what if a sailor plugged that line into 'repeat_twice'?
      Would the result be the following?
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
    Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
  Then wouldn't you be upset at me, and react in the following way?
    Socrates: Hey! Don't you know it's impolite to finish someone's sentence?
Socrates: I suppose that I would, Meno. Though the question is a little
  contrived perhaps. Every time I ever considered painting any picture,
  this little voice in my head urged me not to do it.
Meno: Perhaps that's for the best, Socrates. But suppose that instead of
  philosophers, the two of us were sailors. And suppose as sailors, we had
  the following conversation together:
    Socrates: And if I asked you to plug that line into your 'repeat_twice'
      function, would the result be the following?
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
    Meno: YES.
    Socrates: What if instead of you, what if a cobbler plugged that line
      into your 'repeat_twice'? Would the result be the following?
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
    Meno: YES.
    Socrates: And what if a painter plugged that line into 'repeat_twice'?
      Would the result be the following?
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
    Meno: YES.
    Socrates: And what if a sailor plugged that line into 'repeat_twice'?
      Would the result be the following?
      Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
    Meno: Socrates, nice to see you. I've been wanting to talk to you.
  Then wouldn't you be upset at me, and react in the following way?
Socrates: Hey! Don't you know it's impolite to finish someone's sentence?
Meno: Hey! You're one to talk, Socrates! You just finished my sentence!
Socrates: I guess I must have been talking to myself. Splendid, Meno,
  splendid. So you see, a philosophical conversation can get quite
  confusing, can't it?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And if these indentations on this tablet here were copied wrong,
  the conversation would be totally unfollowable, wouldn't it?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And there's nothing stopping us from going even deeper, is there?
  If I can goad you into anticipating lines, and if you can goad me into
  anticipating groups of lines, couldn't I goad you to anticipate groups
  of groups of lines, Meno?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And you could goad me into anticipating groups of groups of groups
  of lines?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And I could goad you into anticipating groups of groups of groups
  of groups of lines?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And you could goad me into anticipating groups of groups of groups
  of groups of groups of lines?
Meno: YES. And next you're going to say, you could goad me into anticipating
  groups of groups of groups of groups of groups of groups of lines.
Socrates: And so on forever?
Meno: YES. And now I see why they accuse you of corrupting the youth.
Socrates: But Meno, that's ridiculous. I mean, if you wanted to grow two
  feet taller, you'd have a very difficult time doing it. But if you want
  to think new things, you can do that without any effort. So don't you
  think it's much easier to change your mind than it is to change your body?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And all these things we've been saying are just idle thoughts,
  aren't they? You could ponder these things all day and night. But trying
  to change your hair color or your eye color by pondering the kind of things
  we're discussing, would be totally futile and impossible, wouldn't it?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: So one cannot corrupt the youth just by contemplating thoughts
  together with them. For they can change their thoughts as easily as you
  can imagine a mountain of gold, can't you?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And changing people's thoughts is like writing Greek on the surface
  of the water. The water is so pliable you can write on it with your finger.
  But the instant that you've written it, your writing disappears, doesn't it?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: So to really corrupt the youth, you'd have to corrupt their bodies,
  not their minds. Wouldn't you?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And isn't the eye the most fragile and sensitive part of the body?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And the slightest damage to the eye is more grievous than a more
  violent wound anywhere else in the body?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: So if someone were going to corrupt the youth, they should try
  to corrupt the eyes of the youth, shouldn't they?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: But no-one could convince a man to put out his own eye, right?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Then, to corrupt a man's eye, one would have to trick him into
  doing something that hurts his eye, yes?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: One would have to persuade him to do something that damages his
  eye slowly. One would have to persuade him to hurt his eye in such a way
  that he didn't even know he was hurting it. Otherwise, he would quickly
  turn against you, wouldn't he?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Can you think of any way a man could damage his own eye like that?
Meno: Well, he could stare the sun, Socrates.
Socrates: So then, to corrupt the youth in the most efficient and reliable
  way, one should persuade them to stare at the sun?
Meno: YES. That is, if one wanted to corrupt the youth, Socrates. Not that
  either of us wants that.
Socrates: But if you convinced a young man to stare at the sun, wouldn't
  wiser men come to his rescue? Wouldn't they tell him, 'Stop! You must not
  stare at the sun! It will make you go blind!'?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And so in order for your diabolical plan to work, you would have
  to anticipate that, wouldn't you? You'd have to not just persuade your
  young victim that he should gaze at the sun, but even predict that his
  elders will say 'Stop!'. You'd have to make him think his elders were
  wrong, wouldn't you?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: But he loves his elders. He would never believe they would
  intentionally lie to him. You'd have to convince him his elders meant
  the best, but that they themselves were decieved.
Meno: YES.
Socrates: You'd have to convince him they're like men in a cave, staring
  at shadows on the wall. That the sun is a fire behind them, casting
  those shadows. And that their eyes are accustomed to the dark, and that
  in order to escape the cave, they must turn and face the sun, wouldn't you?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And then when their elders cried, 'Stop!', they would say to
  themselves: 'These elders do not realize we are in a cave. They think
  this fire is the sun, and it will burn up my pupils.' Wouldn't they?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And if the youth ever returned to that cave, after dwelling in the
  bright outside, they really would be quite blind, while their eyes
  readjusted to the darkness, wouldn't they?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And their elders would say, 'You should have listened to us!
  We told you you would go blind if you stared at the sun like that! If
  only you had listened!'
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And what would happen to whoever it was that told that youth to
  turn and face the fire in the cave? He'd be accused of corrupting the
  youth, wouldn't he?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: But let's get back on track. Suppose instead of handing you the
  first two lines of this conversation as X, suppose I handed you the whole
  conversation as X, up until I said 'But let's get back on track'. And
  suppose I wanted your function to output the first line, twice. While
  ignoring everything after that first line. Can you write such a function?
Meno: Sure, that's easy.
  def repeat_first_line_twice(X):
    first_line = X[0]
    print(first_line)
    print(first_line)
Socrates: It occurred to me just now that someone could make this tablet
  here even more confusing than it already is, Meno.
Meno: How, Socrates?
Socrates: By becoming a philosopher and changing their name to
  'def repeat_first_line_twice(X)'. Then people wouldn't know if you
  were enunciating computer code here, or if the philosopher named
  'def repeat_first_line_twice(X)' suddenly showed up and started talking.
Meno: I didn't realize you took up comedy, Socrates.
Socrates: Nonsense, Meno. You knew it all along, but you only just remembered.
  Now, when you say X[0], what exactly does that mean?
Meno: It means, the zeroth element of X, Socrates. Computers start counting
  from zero, you know. So if X was ['red', 'blue'], then X[0] would be 'red',
  for example.
Socrates: You'll have to tell me more about this 'zero' sometime. Now let
  me make sure I understand right. Suppose our dialog so far was nothing
  but the following.
    Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
    Socrates: Good morning, Meno.
    Meno: Pleasant weather today, isn't it?
  If I plugged those lines into your 'repeat_first_line_twice' function, then
  the output would be the following, wouldn't it?
    Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
    Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Because X[0] would be 'Meno: Good morning, Socrates.', right?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And X[1] would be 'Socrates: Good morning, Meno.'?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Well, what if our dialog so far contained nothing but the following
  lines.
    Meno: Look, Socrates, I found a tablet and it says
      the following line:
        Meno: Made you look!
  Then, if we plugged that into your 'repeat_first_line_twice' function,
  the output would be the following, wouldn't it?
    Meno: Look, Socrates, I found a tablet and it says
    Meno: Look, Socrates, I found a tablet and it says
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Because in that case, the X[0] in your function would be,
  'Meno: Look, Socrates, I found a tablet and it says'?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And X[1] would be, '  the following line:'?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: Because '  the following line:' is line number '1' in that
  example dialog, assuming you count from zero?
Meno: YES.
Socrates: And X[2] would be, '    Meno: Made you look!'?
Meno: YES.


Meno: It wants a password.
Socrates: So now the question is whether or not the program predicted
  what you would say when you ran it. And what you said when you ran
  it is:
    It wants a password.
  Now you're in a bind, Meno. For until you enter the password, you
  will not know what it will say once you enter it. For example, maybe
  if you just enter the password, your program will immediately say,
    It wants a password.
  And you can't say your code heard this part of the conversation we are
  having now, after you ran it. For an algorithm has no ears to hear with,
  and while it is waiting for a user to enter a password, it cannot
  hear what is being said around it. So if, once the password is entered,
  it then predicts what was said in the meantime, then that is just as
  good as if it predicted it all it advance, without the password. Ah!
  But you can read the code yourself, Meno. It is too late for you to say
  the opposite of
    It wants a password.
  But maybe you can just study the code, Meno, and figure out what the
  next thing is that it will predict from you. Figure that out, Meno,
  and then say the opposite! Study the code, Meno! Analyze it, and
  anticipate it!
Meno: It's encrypted.
Socrates: You really do surprise me, Meno, and I bow to your ingenuity.
  For truly you are much more a genius than I am, for I would never have
  thought to encrypt the code with a password. Well, if the code is
  encrypted, then I suppose you cannot study it to see what it would
  predict upon receiving the right password. If you could decrypt it,
  you could study it, and you could have seen it would predict you would
  say,
    It wants a password.
    I would, except it's encrypted.
  And even though it was too late to say the opposite of
    It wants a password.
  still, you could still have said the opposite of
    I would, except it's encrypted.
  if you could only have decrypted it. Well, Meno, it seems you have no
  choice now. You must enter the password, and we shall see what your
  program predicted. So then! Meno! Tell me! What is the password?
Meno: I don't know the password, Socrates.
Socrates: Thank you, Meno! I should have guessed a devious mind like
  yours would have come up with such a self-referential password.
  So! The password, in your own words, dear Meno, is:
    I don't know the password, Socrates.
  Enter it, then, and if your wisdom is as great as you have demonstrated
  to me already, then I think as soon as you enter that password, your
  program will say:
    Meno: It wants a password.
    Meno: I would, except it's encrypted.
    Meno: I don't know the password, Socrates.
  But now I must leave you, Meno.
