Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
Socrates: Good morning to you, Meno, my friend.
Meno: [I've been|I was] [wanting|meaning] to talk [to|with] you.
Socrates: [And [just ]what|What] [would you like|do you want] to talk about[, [[my ]dear ]friend]?
Meno: [It concerns|It's about] [what|something] you said[ to me] [the ]last time [we|you and I] spoke[ together].
Socrates: [I [suppose|reckon] you mean|You mean[,]] when I [told you|argued|suggested] that learning is really [just|just the same as|no different than] remembering?
Meno: [Yes, [and ]t][Yes, T]hat we [actually ][know everything already|already know everything], and [we ]merely [recall|remember] it.
Socrates: [And ]I suppose you've [come up with|invented|contrived|discovered] some [[sort|kind] of ]paradox [or something ]to [try and ][disprove [it|that]|prove it wrong]?
Meno: Quite. Once we finish this [delightful ][discussion|conversation] [we're|we are] [having|currently having|having right now], don't you think [that then ][I will|I'll] know [all ]the [various ]things we [will have ]said[ in it]?
Socrates: You mean, know the conversation?
Meno: [Right|Yes|Exactly|Precisely]. [After|Once|As soon as] [we're [done|finished]|we [finish|part ways]], [I'll|I will|I shall] [then ]know [the things|what] we said. [That is|In other words], [I will|I shall|I'll] [have learned it|then have learned it][, [wouldn't|don't] you [say|think|agree]?|.]
Socrates: I'm not [really ][so ][sure|certain] [about|of] that[, Meno]. [I often|More often than not, I] [find|realize] I mis-remember conversations, or, [what's|even] worse, when I think [that ]I remember [them ]and understand them, [and then ]it [later |eventually |sometimes |][turns out|happens] [that] I [either] remember wrong, or understand wrong. Besides[ that], [your question|this question of yours] makes me [a little ][uneasy|nervous], for I feel as if I am in danger of falling into a trap somehow.
Meno: What! Does the great Socrates have trouble with his [memory|memories]?
Socrates: [I often|Quite often I] wish [that ]I [[could remember|remembered] things better|had [better|greater] memory], Meno. For I feel sometimes as though I [flit|flitter] between two [different ]worlds. [The one|The first|One] is [intelligible and beautiful|beautiful and intelligible], [and |while |]the other is [sensuous and profane|profane and sensuous]. For [example|instance], when my house is well[-| ]organized, [and|so|so that] I remember where I [have ]put [everything|my things], [it's|it is] as if I [live|dwell] in a house [designed|created|built] by the geometers, for I can find my shirt [or|and] my shoes by an act of pure [thinking|thought]. But [more often|most of the time], [[unfortunately|alas|sadly|I'm sad to say|it pains me to say|I'm afraid], [oh Meno, ]]my house is [not [so ]|less well ]organized, and I must [grope|scrounge] around for my shirt [or|and] [my ]shoes, [and I feel ]as if [I'm|I've been] cast out [of|from] that house of the geometers, and [plunged into|[imprisoned|trapped] [in|inside|within]] a carnal house of the [five ]senses.
Meno: Well, [I, for one,|as for me, I] take [great ]pride in my house [always being|being always] [well-]organized. [That's easy, for|For] I [have|employ] servants [who|to] [keep it organized|organize it|keep it in order] for me. And, look here: I have a servant [writing|inscribing] this [very ]conversation [of ours ]on a stone tablet, here. You know him[, Socrates]: [he|it] is the same boy [you [conversed|spoke] with|with whom you [spoke|conversed]] about geometry the last time you visited. I treasure your words like gold, Socrates, and I will preserve them, and guard them, [just as|just like|the same way] I would [guard|treat] a [great|valuable|priceless] treasure.
Socrates: You flatter me very greatly, Meno. But I suspect you're just saying that because you want to catch me in some trap. Very well, Meno. For the sake of the argument, I grant that after we have this conversation, you shall have learned it.
Meno: Well then, doesn't that mean [that ]I already [know|knew] it, and [have only|had only|needed only|only needed|only had|only have] to [remember|recall][ it]?
Socrates: Yes, I grant that, Meno. [Even|Long] before [you were born|your mother gave birth to you], you already knew I would say[ the words][,] 'Yes, I grant that, Meno,' [which I [said|uttered|spoke] ]just [now|a [second|moment] ago].
Meno: Well then, [dear ]Socrates, [I have|I propose|[I'd like|I want] to [pose|propose]] a challenge for you. [With|Using] your [in]famous method of [questioning|asking questions], please [help|guide] me to [remember|recall] [all [of ]the things|everything] [[we're|we are] going to|we will|we'll|we shall] say in this dialogue[ we're having| we're engaged in]. That is, if [you are able to|you can]. But I doubt [it|you can[ do it]].
Socrates: [Why|And why] do you doubt I can do it, [[my ]dear ]Meno?
Meno: Because [as soon as|the [very ][instant|moment|second]] you help me remember [the things|what] we're going to [say to|tell] [each other|one another], I [shall|will] immediately remember what line I [will ]say next, and I will say the very opposite.
Socrates: That's very clever, Meno. Let me see if I understand right. So if I help you [recall|remember] what [things ]we're [about to|going to] [say to|tell] [each other|one another], and [then |thus|]you [recall|remember][, for [example|instance],] that in [response|reply] to my [thus |so |][helping|guiding|leading|teaching|directing] you, you [are [next ]going to|will next|will then] say 'Thank you Socrates,' then, [knowing that|with that knowledge|armed with that knowledge], you will [instead ][deliberately|purposefully] [say|defy that prediction by saying][,] 'No thank you, Socrates'?
Meno: Exactly. Or suppose that you help me remember all the things we're going to say, and as a part of that, in particular, I [then ]remember that [as soon as|the instant|the moment] [you finish|you're finished|you're done] thus [helping|guiding] me, I will [then ]say 'You win, Socrates!' [And then|Then], [instead of|rather than] saying 'You win, Socrates!', I will say, 'You lose, Socrates!' Nor will I be lying, [because|for] my very [act of my ]saying 'You lose, Socrates!' will [[prove|demonstrate|show|be proof]|be the [proof|demonstration]] that you [did indeed lose|lost|failed], [because|for] if the memory you [made|helped] me remember was accurate, I would have [instead ]said 'You win.'
Socrates: But what if I help you remember [all ]the things [we're|we are] going to say, and, as a part of that, in particular, you [remember|recall] that as soon as I finish thus [helping|assisting] you, you will say, 'You lose, Socrates!' Then, according to your [plan|scheme|strategy|stratagem], you will say the opposite, which is, 'You win, Socrates!' [Wouldn't|Won't] I then have won, by your own admission[?|, Meno?]
Meno: No, [Socrates|my friend]. The [purpose|point] of this challenge is not for you to [make me|get me to] [say|utter] the [words|phrase], "You win, Socrates!" Rather, the purpose [of this challenge ]is for you to guide me [to remember|toward remembering] what [I am|I'm] going to say, whether [that's|that be] "You lose, Socrates!" or "You win, Socrates!", it doesn't matter. And when I intentionally say the [precise |exact |]opposite of what I remember I was going to say[ next]; [and ]then you [shall |will |]lose the challenge, Socrates, whether that opposite statement [is|be] "You win, Socrates!" or "You lose, Socrates!"
Socrates: Very well. This is a fun challenge. And I think if I'm to have any hope at succeeding, I will need to resort to computer programming.
Meno: [Perhaps|Maybe so|You could]. For [this|my] [challenge ]is [obviously|clearly] related to things like the recursion theorem [and|or] the incompleteness theorem. But even computer programming won't rescue you from my paradox.
Socrates: We'll see. But if I do succeed [at|in] this [challenge|task], [that|it] would be quite impressive, [wouldn't it|don't you think|don't you agree]?
Meno: [Certainly|Indubitably|Quite].
Socrates: And the reason it would be impressive is because I helped you predict the very future, right?
Meno: Yes.
Socrates: [And would|Would] it be equally impressive if I helped you [to ]remember the past? For [example|instance], if I [helped|were to help] you [remember|recall] that you [began|started] this [whole ][conversation|discussion] by saying 'Good morning, Socrates'?
Meno: No.
Socrates: Well then, by Olympus, wouldn't it at least be impressive if I helped you remember a large amount of the past? For [example|instance], if I helped you [to remember|to recall|remember] this [whole|entire|whole entire] conversation from 'Good morning, Socrates', all the way up to 'Well then, by Olympus'? [Wouldn't that be|Would that not be] impressive?
Meno: No.
Socrates: So what you've said in the past is, in [some|a certain] sense, trivial?
Meno: [Yes|Quite trivial|Most trivial][, Socrates].
Socrates: But what you'll say in the future is deep and mysterious?
Meno: Yes.
Socrates: And if I tried to invoke something deep and mysterious, then that would be cheating, right? For [example|instance], [if I said|were I to say], 'You [are next going to say|will next say] the thing that you [are next going to say|will next say],' that would [certainly ]not be impressive, would it?
Meno: That would be [most|quite] unimpressive.
Socrates: But if I [invoked|were to invoke] something trivial, that would be fine, right? For example, if, as part of my questioning, I remind you [that ]we are standing in Athens, that would be [perfectly ]reasonable, [right|wouldn't it]?
Meno: [Of course|Perfectly reasonable].
Socrates: So for example, suppose I ask you: take the first sentence you said to me, and repeat it to me again right now, and then afterward, please repeat it to me [again ]a second time. And suppose I [claimed|asserted] that, by [doing so|so doing], you would recite our [entire|whole] conversation. Would I be right?
Meno: [Absolutely|Certainly] not.
Socrates: Why not?
Meno: Well, suppose I did exactly [what you propose|that]. Then I would say: 'Good morning, Socrates. Goodmorning, Socrates.'
Socrates: Well, [wouldn't that be|isn't that] a conversation? Albeit, a [bit|little] one-sided?
Meno: It would be a [very ]short[,| and] one-sided conversation.
Socrates: But [I would|I'd] be wrong when I claimed that [that ]one-sided conversation was [our|this] [entire|whole] conversation we are having?
Meno: [Absolutely|Most|Quite] wrong.
Socrates: Why?
Meno: Well, for one[ thing], at the start of this conversation [we're|we are] having, I did not greet you twice in a row like that. For another[ thing], you responded to me, [whereas|but] in the one-sided conversation in question, you [did not|didn't][ respond[ to me]].
Socrates: So the reason [why ]this supposed one-sided conversation would not win your challenge, is because of the content of the results?
Meno: [Yes|Indeed|Quite so].
Socrates: [And is|Is] there any other reason why this supposed one-sided conversation would not [win|beat] your challenge?
Meno: No.
Socrates: In that one-sided example, I used earlier pieces of our conversation as tools. But you say, the [lone|only|sole] reason [why ]that example [would fail|failed] to solve the challenge, is [because of|due to] the content[s] of the resulting one-sided conversation?
Meno: That's right.
Socrates: Then it's perfectly alright for me to use earlier pieces of our conversation [like that|that way]?
Meno: [Certainly|Yes, that's [certainly ][fine|alright]].
Socrates: Well, [supposing|suppose] I [said to|instructed] you: 'Take [our|this] [whole|entire|whole entire] conversation up until I said the word octopus. Repeat that whole conversation back to me. Then repeat that whole conversation back to me a second time.' Would that [solve|[be|give] a solution to] your challenge?
Meno: [Not at all|Certainly not|Of course not|Obviously not].
Socrates: Because the content[s] of the resulting conversation would [not [equal|be equal to]|be unequal to] [our|the] actual conversation?
Meno: Yes. For example, in the resulting conversation, you would say: '...up until I said the word octopus'. [And then|Then], because at that point [I would|I'd] [have finished|be done with] the first repetition and it would be time [for|to start in on] the second one, I would say: 'Good morning, Socrates.'
Socrates: Whereas, in [our|the] [actual|true|real] conversation, [after|when] I said the word octopus, you did not immediately say 'Good morning, Socrates'?
Meno: [Yes|Right|That's right].
Socrates: Then we shall have to think of a more clever method. But first, let's consider the example more deeply. Let X denote our [whole|entire] conversation up until, and including, when I said [the word octopus|"octopus"]. [And suppose|Suppose] I wanted [to ask ]you to repeat X to me, and then to repeat X to me a second time. [Can|Could] you [program|write] a function that would take X and repeat it that way?
Meno: Certainly[. T|, t]hat's easy. How about this?
  def repeat_twice(X):
    print(X)
    print(X)
Socrates: So[ then,] if I [asked|instructed] you to take the first [sentence|line] you [said to me|greeted me with], and plug it [in to|into] [this ]'repeat_twice'[ function], the resulting output would be as follows?
  Good morning, Socrates.
  Good morning, Socrates.
Meno: [That's right|Yes|Quite so].
Socrates: [And w|What] if I asked you to take the nineteenth sentence you said to me, and plug that into 'repeat_twice'? What would [be the result|the result be]?
Meno: [I'm afraid ]I [can't|cannot|don't|do not] remember exactly what that nineteenth sentence was.
Socrates: [Can|Can't] you think of [any|some] way [of [recalling it|reminding yourself]|we could recall it]?
Meno: [Well, y|Y]es. We could [read it [from|in|off [from|of]]|[look it up|look for it] in] my servant boy's tablet here. He's been diligently writing down this conversation for me. You know I [treasure|value] your words more than gold, Socrates.
Socrates: I [should|must] [again|once more] warn you not to read[ or write] too much philosophy, [Meno|my dear friend]. For you cannot [question|ask questions of] a book, [and ]neither can [a|the] book question you. But in this case I admit it's convenient. You say [that ]by consulting [this|your servant's] tablet, we can recall [exactly|precisely] what the nineteenth sentence you said was?
Meno: [Yes|Indeed|That's right|Easily|With ease].
Socrates: But isn't your servant writing [some ]other things here? Look. He writes 'Meno:' [whenever|when] you begin [talk|speak]ing. He writes 'Socrates:' [whenever|when] I [do|talk|speak].
Meno: [Yes|Sure].
Socrates: We have a [very ]serious problem, then. Look [here on the tablet|at the tablet right here], [near|right near] the [very ]top. It says: 'Good morning to you, Meno, my friend. Meno:' Now I can't remember. Did I say 'Meno:' immediately after I said 'Good morning to you, Meno, my friend'? Or [rather, ]does 'Meno:' here mean that you [started|began] talking?
Meno: I believe it means [that ]I started talking. I [don't think|[highly |really ]doubt] you literally said 'Meno, my friend, Meno'.
Socrates: But look [right ]here, near the bottom[ of [the|our|your] tablet]. It says, quote: Did I say 'Meno:' immediately after I said 'Good morning to you, Meno, my friend'? Unquote. Well[,] then. I know it was [me|I] who said 'Did I say', but [then ]who said 'immediately'? [Which one is it? ]Did Socrates say, 'Did I say Meno: immediately after...'? Or did I [merely ]say 'Did I say' and then [at that point ]Meno [jumped in|interrupted[ me]] [and said|to say] 'immediately after'?
Meno: I'm pretty sure you said 'Did I say Meno: immediately after...'
Socrates: But the tablet itself [doesn't|does not] tell us for certain?
Meno: I [suppose|guess] it [might not|doesn't].
Socrates: And just think. If you were reading this tablet by your lonesome, you couldn't even ask it whether this 'Socrates:' here means that Meno said 'Socrates:', or whether it means Socrates [started|began] [talking|speaking]. [So|Now] [do ]you see the danger, [then|my friend], of reading too much philosophy?
Meno: [Perhaps|Maybe].
Socrates: And your challenge is quite hopeless. For if I claim to remind you what our whole conversation is, you [won't be able|will be unable] to check [whether|if|whether or not] my claim is true. [For|Because] you can't tell from this tablet who said what when, can you?
Meno: I [suppose|guess] not.
Socrates: But maybe we can modify the challenge. Do you at least know what is written on the tablet? For [example|instance], that the very first letter [on the tablet ]is [a ]'G'?
Meno: [Yes|Certainly|Indeed].
Socrates: Then maybe instead of helping you to recall our future conversation, I could instead help you to recall the future contents of the tablet. Your little paradox would still [apply|confound me|trap me], [wouldn't it|would it not]?
Meno: [It would|Quite|Absolutely].
Socrates: [And ]I wouldn't even need to help you recall my own future contributions to the tablet, would I? Wouldn't you [say I won|grant me victory] if I could just help you recall your future contributions to the tablet?
Meno: [I'm not|I don't think I'm] [entirely |quite |]sure what you mean by that, Socrates.
Socrates: [Let me|I shall] give you an example. Suppose I [helped|could help] you to remember that your own future contributions to the tablet would be[ this]:
  Wow!
  You win, Socrates!
And suppose [that ][immediately after|the very [instant|moment|second]|as soon as] I so helped you, you [said|were to say], "Wow!" And then suppose [that ]I said, "Do I win, Meno?" [And then|After which] you [then ]said, "You win, Socrates!" In that scenario, would you grant me victory? Even though I did not help you remember my future contributions, namely "Do I win, Meno?", but only your own contributions?
Meno: [I suppose ]I would [grant you|not begrudge you] [the |a |]victory[ in that case| if that were to happen|, if [all[ of] ]that were to happen|], Socrates.
Socrates: [Then|Well,] suppose I [were to ]announce: "Meno's next contribution to the tablet shall be 'You win, Socrates.' Meno: You win, Socrates." [That is to say|In other words], first, I announce that Meno's next contribution on the tablet will be, "You win, Socrates". [And at|At] that [point|moment], I suppose [you would|you'd] [want|try] to [pipe|jump] in and say "You lose, Socrates". But before you have [a chance|the opportunity|the time|a moment][ to do that], I quickly [say|add], "Meno: You win, Socrates". Wouldn't I win then?
Meno: [|No! |By no means! | Hardly! ]That would be cheating, [Socrates|friend]. You know they say, only a fool puts words in other people's mouths. We would both know that you had cheated and had not won. And before you say that someone reading this tablet here would think you had won, because they were confused by your linguistic trick, the truth is, not even a reader of the tablet after the fact would think you won. And that's because your challenge is not to help me remember a little part of my future contributions to the tablet. Your challenge is to help me remember all of my future contributions to the tablet, and in the correct order, too. So in that example [of yours|you just gave], after [you say|you've said] "You win, Socrates. Meno: You win, Socrates," I would [then ]say, "You cheat, Socrates." And then even someone reading the tablet[ years later], who was [not|never] here in person, [would [still ]know|could [still ][tell|see]] you did not win. Because they would see that I contributed the words, "You cheat, Socrates" to the tablet, [and|whereas] you did not predict those.
Socrates: You are [very |most |][cunning|clever], Meno. I [think not|doubt] even Ulysses could [trick|outsmart] you.
Meno: [Why do you say that|What do you mean by that], Socrates?
Socrates: Do you remember how Ulysses tricked Polyphemus, the cyclops? He lied to Polyphemus, he said his name was Noman. [Then w|W]hen Polyphemus's friends came and asked if some man was slaying him, Polyphemus [said|shouted], 'Noman is slaying me.' Didn't Ulysses do that on purpose, so that the cyclops's friends would [misunderstand[,]|be misled] and think Polyphemus [had ]said "No man is slaying me"? Isn't that exactly the kind of syntactical-semantical confusion you have so effortlessly avoided just now?
Meno: I [guess|suppose|reckon] [it is|so].
Socrates: I think this challenge is [very|quite] difficult, and I almost want to give up, except a [certain ]voice [in|inside] my head compels me not to[ do that]. Certainly this task [is beyond|exceeds] my own power[, and|;] I can only [hope|pray] that it is within your power, Meno. So I will ask you questions[,] and [we will|we'll] [see|find out] whether you can [figure out how|find a way] to defeat yourself in this challenge, though I daresay you have a conflict of interest[ in the matter| here|]. Let us start from the beginning. Doesn't the first line on this tablet say, "Meno: Good morning, Socrates"?
Meno: We've [thoroughly |already |]established that.
Socrates: [And i|I]f I asked you to plug that line into your 'repeat_twice' function, would the [result|output] be [the following|as follows]?
  Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
  Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
Meno: [Yes|Yes, [of course|it would[ be]|I believe so]].
Socrates: What if instead of you, a cobbler [were to plug|plugged] that line into [your ]'repeat_twice'? Would the result be the following?
  Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
  Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
Meno: Again[,] yes.
Socrates: And what if a painter plugged that line into 'repeat_twice'?
  Would the result be the following?
  Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
  Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
Meno: [Yes, [it|the result|the output]|[Indeed. |Of course. |Certainly. |][It|The result|The output]] [would [still be so|be the same|not change|still not change]|wouldn't change|wouldn't differ], even if we were painters.
Socrates: And what if a sailor plugged that line into 'repeat_twice'?
  Would the result be the following?
  Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
Socrates: Hey! Don't you [know|think] it's [impolite|not polite|rude|a bit rude|a little rude|inconsiderate] to finish [someone[ else]|another person|another man]'s sentence for him[ like that]?
Meno: [I'm sorry|Forgive me], Socrates. [It's just that|But] you were being rather predictable[ just now].
Socrates: I was doing that on purpose[,] [because|for] I suspected you'd react that way[ eventually]. You see, I wanted to show you something. Look on the tablet near the bottom here, where you finished my sentence for me just now. Don't you think someone could get confused[,] reading this?
Meno: [Quite|Absolutely] confused.
Socrates: So then, reading philosophy from a [tablet|book|tablet, or a book], without [being able|the ability|the chance] to ask [the philosopher questions|questions [to|of] the philosopher], [isn't|is not] much good, is it?
Meno: Sure it's no good, Socrates, [provided|if] the tablet was deliberately designed to be confusing! You know, I'm [almost ]starting to understand why [they|some people] accuse you of corrupting the youth.
Socrates: Meno, that's a ridiculous [rumour|slander]. All [[I have|I've] ever done|I ever did] to the youth is [inspire|motivate|encourage] them to think a little[ bit]. [But|And] anyone can think [anything|whatever] they want, and then turn around and unthink it just as easily.
Meno: [True|Certainly].
Socrates: And all these things we've been saying are just idle thoughts, aren't they? You could ponder these things all day and [all ]night, and then the very next [day|morning], you could ponder the exact opposite.
Meno: [You're right|I agree|That's right].
Socrates: [So o|O]ne cannot corrupt the youth[, then,] just by contemplating thoughts together with them. For one can change one's thoughts just as [easily|effortlessly] as one can imagine a mountain [made ]of gold, [don't|wouldn't] you agree?
Meno: [If|When] you put [it|things] [that way|like that], [yes|sure].
Socrates: And changing people's thoughts is like writing Greek on the surface of the water. [For t|T]he water is so pliable[,] you can write on it with your bare finger[s]. But the instant that you've written there, your writing [disappears|vanishes], doesn't it?
Meno: [Yes|Certainly|It does|It certainly does].
Socrates: In fact, I always assumed that's what Thales meant, when he said[ that] everything is made [out ]of water. He meant that[, in time,] all the impressions we make on [the|this] world fade[| away| out], [just ]as [if|though] we inscribed them on the face of the sea. You could not corrupt the Aegean by writing on its surface, no matter how scandalous the things you wrote there. Even [language itself|the language we speak] [changes|slowly changes|gradually changes]. And we [attempt|try] to nail that down, by imposing sharp constraints on it in [our|the form of] poetry. But over long enough time, even that fails, and it's like trying to keep the tide from going out by nailing the water to the sand. [In the same way|Likewise|Similarly], [I believe ]you [could never|couldn't ever] corrupt a man just by writing thoughts [into|onto|upon] his mind, Meno.
Meno: But surely you [do|must] admit some corrupt youths exist, don't you, Socrates?
Socrates: I admit it.
Meno: [Then|Well,] how could any youth be corrupted, if not through his [mind|thoughts]?
Socrates: Youths have physical bodies, too, besides just their minds, don't they?
Meno: [Yes|Of course].
Socrates: So to really corrupt the youth, you'd have to corrupt their bodies, not their minds.[ Wouldn't you?]
Meno: [Perhaps|Maybe].
Socrates: And isn't the eye [by far ]the most fragile and sensitive [part of the body|body part|body-part]?
Meno: [So it would [appear|seem]|It would [appear|seem] so].
Socrates: And isn't the slightest damage to the eye more grievous than a [violent|terrible] wound elsewhere on the body?
Meno: Within reasonable limits, [yes|sure].
Socrates: So if someone [wanted|were going] to corrupt the youth, they should try to corrupt the eyes of the youth, shouldn't they?
Meno: [Perhaps|Maybe].
Socrates: And [perhaps|maybe] that's why people think [I'm|I have] [such ]a corrupting influence[,|:] not because of [these|the] words I say, but because of these bulging, bugging eyes I have. And because my eyes bulge out, people [assume|think|fear|worry] their children's eyes will bulge out from talking to me. As if it is not we who converse, but as if our eyes are men conversing [with each other|together]. But no man could convince a person to [deliberately |purposely |intentionally |][harm|hurt|damage] his own eye, [right|surely|could he]?
Meno: No man except maybe Noman.
Socrates: Then, to corrupt a man's eye, one would have to trick him into doing something that hurts his eye without him knowing it?
Meno: I [guess|reckon] so[, Socrates].
Socrates: One would have to persuade him [to do|into doing] something that [damages|hurts] his eye [slowly|gradually]. One would have to [persuade|convince] him to [damage|hurt] his eye in [such a way|some way such] that he didn't even [know|realize] he was [doing so|hurting it]. [Otherwise|Or else|For otherwise|For if not], [the victim|he] would [quickly ]turn against you, wouldn't he?
Meno: Yes, and [he would|he'd] [despise|hate] you[, too].
Socrates: Can you think of any way a man could damage his own eye like that?
Meno: Well, he could stare at the sun, Socrates.
Socrates: So [then, ]to corrupt the youth in the most [efficient|reliable|efficient and reliable] way, one should [persuade them to stare|trick them into staring] at the sun?
Meno: Yes. That is, if one wanted to corrupt the youth, Socrates. Not that either of us wants that.
Socrates: But if you [did convince|convinced] a young man to stare at the sun, wouldn't wiser men [come to his rescue|rescue him]? Wouldn't they [tell him|say], 'Stop! You [must not|mustn't] stare at the sun! It will [make you go blind|blind you]!'?
Meno: [Yes|Indeed].
Socrates: And so in order for your diabolical plan to work, you would have to anticipate that, wouldn't you? Not unlike [how|the way in which] we're trying to anticipate Meno here. You'd have to not just persuade your young victim [that ]he should gaze at the sun, but even predict [that ]his elders [would|will] [tell him|say] 'Stop!' [And y|Y]ou'd have to make him think his elders were [wrong|mistaken], wouldn't you?
Meno: [There would|There'd] be no other way[to do it].
Socrates: But he loves his elders[!|.] [He would|He'd] never believe they would intentionally [lie to|mislead|deceive] him. You'd have to convince him his elders meant [the best|well], [but|and] that they themselves [were|had been] decieved.
Meno: [[I suppose y|Y][ou'd|ou would] have to].
Socrates: You'd have to convince him they're like men in a cave, staring at shadows on the wall. That the sun is a fire behind them, casting those shadows. And that their eyes are accustomed to the dark, and that in order to escape[ the cave], they must turn and face the sun, wouldn't you?
Meno: [That would be|That is|That'd be] one way to do it.
Socrates: [W|And [then ]w]hen their elders cried, 'Stop!', they would [say|think] to themselves: 'These elders [don't|do not] realize [we're|we are] in a cave. They [believe|think] this fire is the sun, and it will burn [up ]my pupils.' Wouldn't they?
Meno: That would be our [strategy|stratagem], yes.
Socrates: And if some youth [ever ]returned to [that|the] cave, after dwelling [on the bright surface|in the bright outside], they really would be [quite ]blind, while their eyes [|re|re-]adjusted to the darkness, wouldn't they?
Meno: Quite blind[, yes| indeed|].
Socrates: [And t|T]heir elders would [say|lament], 'You should have listened to us! We told you you would go blind if you stared at the sun like that! If only you had listened!'
Meno: Yes, [and ]their [poor ]elders would be [quite|most] [upset|distraught].
Socrates: [W|And w]hat would happen to whoever it was that told that youth to turn and face the fire in the cave? He'd be accused of corrupting the youth, wouldn't he?
Meno: At the very [least|minimum].
Socrates: Because the youth's eyes were damaged? Or because of [the ]thoughts in the youth's [mind|head]?
Meno: Because the youth's eyes were damaged, [obviously|clearly|of course].
Socrates: So then, [there's|there is] no danger [[that ]I'll corrupt|of [me|my] corrupting] you, Meno, merely by making you think about lines of text on a tablet, is there?
Meno: None[ at all| whatsoever|].
Socrates: [Then|In that case,] let's proceed. For the last thing I would ever want to do to you is corrupt you, Meno.
Meno: [Please do|Yes], Socrates, let's get back to the issue at hand. [Don't|I don't want you to] [dodge|evade] my challenge by [going off on|pursuing|chasing after] some wild tangent. [Let me|I'll] remind you of your precarious position. You claimed, [the ]last time we met, that [there is|there's] no such thing as learning, rather, there is only remembering. I [have ]pointed out that by that logic, I already know all the contents of this [conversation|discussion] [we're|we are] [having|engaged in]. And [I have|I've] challenged you to help me remember those contents. And [you're|you are] stuck[ hard], for [if|should] you succeed in this [challenge|task], I shall immediately say the [very|exact|precise] opposite of what you help me remember I was about to say next.
Socrates: Thank you, [my ]dear Meno, for holding me accountable.
Meno: Let's get on with it, then.
Socrates: Yes, we must proceed. Well, [then, ]suppose instead of handing you the first line of this conversation as X, suppose I handed you the [whole|entire|whole entire] conversation as X, up until [when ]I said 'Yes, we must proceed'. [And s|S]uppose I wanted [your function to|that your function should] output the first five characters[ of X]. What [then ]would it output?
Meno: It would output 'Meno:'
Socrates: [[And|Well,] w|W]hat if I wanted [your function|it] to output the first ten characters?
Meno: [Then i|I]t would output 'Meno:Goodm'.
Socrates: [[And|Well,] w|W]hat would that function be, that outputs the first ten characters?
Meno: It would be [like ]this:
  def output_first_ten(X):
    print(X{:10})
Socrates: But look here. There's some space on your servant's tablet between 'Meno:' and 'Good'. And if someone included that space in the X that they passed you, then your function would not output 'Meno:Goodm', rather it would output 'Meno: Good', wouldn't it?
Meno: [Yes|That's right|It would].
Socrates: Could you modify your function to discard any such spaces? You'd better modify it to discard tabs and line-breaks too, while we're at it.
Meno: Sure. Here's the modified version:
  def output_first_ten_nospace(X):
    X=X.replace(" ","") # Remove spaces
    X=X.replace("\n","") # Remove line-breaks
    X=X.replace("\t","") # Remove tabs
    print(X{:10})
Socrates: And if we changed "ten" to "fourty", what would your function output?
Meno: It would output "Meno:Goodmorning,Socrates.Socrates:Goodm".
Socrates: And it's a good thing we removed the linebreaks, for otherwise it would have output the following:
  Meno:Goodmorning,Socrates.
  Socrates:Good
And I think that would be much harder to work with. So I think we're making progress. We are not limited to printing fragments of earlier conversation directly, are we? We can transform those fragments first, before printing them, can't we? For example, you could write a program that prints the first ten characters of the conversation, but converted to uppercase. What would the result be?
Meno: It would be 'MENO:GOODM'.
Socrates: In that case, can we say that you have taken an initial fragment of our conversation, and you have transformed it in a certain way, and that 'MENO:GOODM' was the output?
Meno: [Yes|Certainly|That's right].
Socrates: Well, as to your challenge, suppose I described a more elaborate transformation. And suppose you performed that transformation on this conversation so far, from the start until the moment when I said "Well, as to your challenge". And suppose that the output was:
  You win, Socrates.
  You're welcome.
  I admit it.
And suppose that as soon as you performed that transformation and saw the output, you immediately said, "You win, Socrates." And suppose after that, I said, "Thank you, Meno." And suppose after that, you said, "You're welcome." And suppose after that, I said, "So you admit that there is no learning, there is only remembering?" And suppose after that, you said, "I admit it." Then I would have passed your challenge?
Meno: Yes, but that would never happen.
Socrates: Why not?
Meno: Because in that situation, after seeing that output, which predicts I will say "You win, Socrates", I would respond by saying the opposite. I would say, "You lose, Socrates". And if instead the output started with "You lose, Socrates", then I would say the opposite of that, and say, "You win, Socrates", but we would both know that I was lying, and that you really lost.
Socrates: Yes, that's what makes this challenge so devious, Meno.
Meno: Do you give up yet, Socrates?
Socrates: It is not I who have the choice to give up or continue, Meno, it is you. For I am only asking questions, you are the one answering them. Indeed, I think that's why this approach cannot work. For you are not a book, Meno. You are not just pre-written lines of text. You do not choose your words blindly, but you choose them in response to things. And before you speak, you consider in your mind what you are going to say, mentally performing calculations that are invisible to me. And in the context of computer programming, what do we call something that does things that way, performing scratch-work in the background to calculate what it will do next?
Meno: We call that a program, Socrates.
Socrates: Well, let us change our approach then. Suppose we described some elaborate transformation. And suppose you performed that transformation on this conversation so far, from the start until the moment when I said, "Well, let me change my approach then." And suppose the output was:
  print("""You win, Socrates.
  You're welcome.
  I admit it.""")
And suppose that as soon as you saw that output, you said, "You win, Socrates," and I said, "Thank you, Meno," and you said, "You're welcome," and I said, "Then you admit there is no learning, only remembering?" and you said, "I admit it." Then I would have passed your challenge?
Meno: [Yes|Certainly|Indeed].
Socrates: Even though what you said started with "You win, Socrates," and not with "print"?
Meno: Yes, in this example your transformation has not directly produced my next lines in the conversation, but rather, a program which produces those lines. I would grant you victory in that case. But again, it will never happen, for the same reason as before, Socrates.
Socrates: What about the following scenario? Suppose we described a transformation, and you performed that transformation on this conversation so far, from the start until the moment when I said, "What about the following scenario?" And suppose the output was:
  socrates_line = input("Enter Socrates' next line: ")
  if socrates_line == "What do you think?":
    print("I think you win, Socrates.")
  else:
    print("I think you lose, Socrates.")
And suppose as soon as you saw that, I said, "What do you think?", and you said, "I think you win, Socrates." Would I have passed your challenge?
Meno: Yes, Socrates. But that would never happen, for the same reason as above.
Socrates: What if, instead of my saying, "What do you think?", I instead said,
  "How now, Meno?", and you said, "I think you lose, Socrates." Would I have
  passed your challenge?
Meno: [Yes|Quite].
Socrates: Why?
Meno: Because the transformation produced a program saying how I will respond to you. And it said that if you next say "What do you think?", I will say "I think you win, Socrates." And that otherwise, I will say, "I think you lose, Socrates." And since you say, "How now, Meno?", rather than, "What do you think?", and since I then say "I think you lose, Socrates," the prediction was correct.
Socrates: But that would never happen, would it?
Meno: No, because I would deliberately defy the prediction. If you said, "What do you think?", I would calculate that the prediction is that I will say "I think you win, Socrates," and I would defy that prediction and say "I think you lose, Socrates." And if you said, "How now, Meno?", I would calculate that the prediction is that I will say "I think you lose, Socrates," and I would defy that prediction and say "I think you win, Socrates." And we would both know I was lying, and that you really lost.
Socrates: You have really put me in a bind here, Meno. I fail to see any way for me to win, unless perhaps some god descends from the machine above, some Deus ex Machina, as in the plays they perform at the festival.
Meno: Do you give up then, Socrates?
Socrates: It feels almost hopeless, but I do have one ray of hope. It is not only me speaking in this conversation, but you too, Meno. So I will guide you to describe a transformation like above, and I will hope that our conversation just so happens to be exactly the right conversation that your transformation will transform into a program that predicts you, not through any wisdom of my own, for I believe I know nothing myself, but through your own mercy and your own wisdom, dear Meno, both of which so far exceed mine. Tell me, is it likely that there is some direct cipher which will transform our conversation into a good program? For example, suppose the transformation says to take our conversation and change every "a" to "b", and every "c" to "d", and so on, and change "z" into "a". Is it at all likely that this transformation would turn our conversation into a program that predicts you?
Meno: It would be an absolute miracle if that transformation turned our conversation into any valid program at all, Socrates. I'm almost certain it would produce pure gibberish. Indeed, our conversation starts with "Meno:Goodmorning,Socrates." So that cipher you just proposed would yield an output starting with "Nfop:Hppenpsojoh,Tpdsbufs." I doubt any computer program starts that way.
Socrates: I guess the problem is that a haystack can't be made entirely out of needles, and if our conversation does secretly hide some program that predicts you, many characters of the conversation must work together to hide each character of the program. Maybe every five characters in our conversation hide one character of the desired program. For example, maybe the correct cipher, instead of changing "a" into "b", changes "Meno:" into "p", and changes "Goodm" into "r", and changes "ornin" into "i", and changes "g,Soc" into "n", and changes "rates" into "t", so that, altogether, the first twenty-five characters of our conversation get changed into "print". Do you think that's likely to work?
Meno: It's more likely than the previous cipher, but only marginally. It would still be a miracle if it worked, only slightly less of a miracle. Five-to-one is still far too many needles and too little hay, Socrates.
Socrates: Would ten characters of conversation per one character of program suffice, then? I mean, could our cipher transform "Meno:Goodm" into "p", and "orning,Soc" into "r", and so on?
Meno: I think ten-to-one is still too little hay, Socrates.
Socrates: Well then, how many characters of conversation do you think would be enough, to encode one character of this program we are looking for?
Meno: I don't really know. I guess it depends on the size of the alphabet used to write the program.
Socrates: You mean, if programs were written with a larger alphabet, then we would need more characters of conversation per character of program?
Meno: [Yes|That's right].
Socrates: Then I guess since we don't have all day to stand here talking, we should agree to write this desired program with as small an alphabet as possible. We should ask ourselves, which characters are absolutely essential for writing computer programs? Within reason, I mean. We're not trying to compete in some obfuscated code contest.
Meno: I think a reasonable alphabet for writing programs would be:
  alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
  alphabet += " ()[]:'=,+.#\n"
  alphabet += '"'
Socrates: Fourty characters in all, right? Since I assume by \n you mean a single linebreak. No uppercase letters?
Meno: For your sake, Socrates, I will consider it a victory for you if our program predicts I will say "hey", even if my servant here actually writes "Hey" with the H uppercase.
Socrates: Most generous of you, Meno. Well then, assuming this bare-bones alphabet is rich enough to write computer programs, how many characters of our conversation should we use to encode each character of our program? We already saw that "one", "five", and "ten" are too small. Maybe twenty?
Meno: Socrates, I know you haven't studied computer science, but really. Twenty is still way too small. I think you're still off by an order of magnitude. Let's make it two hundred.
Socrates: Alright, 200 it shall be. So every 200 characters of our conversation will hide one single character of a computer program. Alright then, how would you define the cipher? It should take a string of 200 characters from our conversation and convert that string into a single character from that 40-letter alphabet you defined earlier.
Meno: Let me think, Socrates. Hmm. Well, there's a convenient function called "ord" which turns characters into numbers. For example, ord("a") is 97, ord("b") is 98, ord("+") is 43, and so on. Don't worry about those exact numbers, Socrates, this "ord" function is built into my programming language (Python). Since our conversation contains quotation marks and my servant here sometimes writes those using fancy unicode open- and close-quotes, whereas other people might use other quote symbols, I guess to be safe we should consider all the quotes in our conversation to be plain ASCII quotes, just like we delete all the spaces and line-breaks and tabs in the conversation. These plain ASCII quotes have ords: for the single-quote, ord("'")=39, and for the double-quote, ord('"')=34. With this ord function, we can turn characters into numbers, add those numbers up, and then take the remainder of the sum upon division by the length of my program alphabet. In other words, if the sum is 40 or higher, smash it down into the range from 0 to 39, so it can be used as the index of a character in our alphabet. Writing it all in computer code:
  def cipher(X):
    total = sum(ord(character) for character in X)
    remainder = total % len(alphabet)
    return alphabet[remainder]
This function will work for inputs X of any length. Of course it is mainly intended for inputs X of length 200.
Socrates: To make sure I understand everything, what would be the value of, say, cipher("Meno:")?
Meno: Well, ord("M") is 77, ord("e") is 101, ord("n") is 110, ord("o") is 111, and ord(":") is 58. Add those up and you get 457. Now, the length of the alphabet is 40. If you divide 457 by 40, you get 11 with a remainder of 17. So the index we get is 457 % 40 = 17. So cipher("Meno:") is alphabet[17], character number 17 in our alphabet, counting from zero. Which is "r". Altogether, cipher("Meno:")="r".
Socrates: Amazing, Meno! And what do we get when we take the first 200 characters of our conversation and plug them into this cipher?
Meno: The first 200 characters of our conversation make the string:
  "(...)"
Plugging that into the cipher function, we get "#".
Socrates: And what about the 200 characters?
Meno: The next 200 characters are:
  "(...)"
Plugging that in, we get "t".
Socrates: So the program we are looking for begins with "#t". Meno, do you think it's possible that "#t" could be the beginning of a valid program?
Meno: Socrates, any line that starts with "#" is a comment, meant for the human reader and not for the machine to run. The program could start with a comment like "#this program predicts meno" or "#the following code generates meno's next lines" or really any comment that starts with "#t"; it's just a comment, so it has no effect on what the program does. So I guess theoretically yes, "#t" could be the start of a valid program.
Socrates: By Zeus! Alright, Meno, now keep going and plug in all the blocks of length 200 from our conversation, right until when I say "By Zeus!" Do we get a valid program? Wait! Don't answer that. You must be very careful what you say next, Meno. Here, take my staff and write the output of your cipher in the sand here, and I will read it aloud, so you can take all the time you need before you choose your next words, my friend. You have written an "i"... and now an "m"... we already knew those two... "p"... yes, yes... Done! The program you have written is:
  #trojan horse
  import random as r
  p=input("password: ")
  z,x=", yo ooned","""n  r''s'
  iati.idnet'pas'r.p(se)d nt yap'o
  +twspcw'tr"""
  d,j=list(range(len(x))),"".join
  s,c=r.seed(p),j(r.sample(p,len(z)))
  r.shuffle(d)
  if c==z:exec(j(x[i]for i in d))
And if, against all odds, this little program does predict you, Meno, then I find it beautiful for its sheer compactness, and I wonder how much more compact it could have been if we'd been more pressed for time in this conversation of ours. Run the program now, Meno! What does it say... or rather, what do you say, upon seeing the output? I understand you plan to say the exact opposite of whatever it says you are going to say, in order to humiliate me. What's wrong? Why are you quiet, Meno? The suspense! Say what the program predicts you'll say, or else say the opposite, Meno, but say something! You behave like the sophistical men I talk to, when my innocent questions put them in some kind of trance. Are you for some reason unable to discern what the program predicts you will say? Is there some problem with our program? What is wrong with our program?
Meno: It wants a password.
Socrates: So now the question is whether or not the program predicted what you would say when you ran it. And what you said when you ran it is:
  It wants a password.
Now you're in a bind, Meno. For until you enter the password, you will not know what it will say once you enter it. For example, maybe if you just enter the password, your program will immediately say,
  It wants a password.
And you can't say your code heard this part of the conversation we are having now, after you ran it. For an algorithm has no ears to hear with, and while it is waiting for a user to enter a password, it cannot hear what is being said around it. So if, once the password is entered, it then predicts what was said in the meantime, then that is just as good as if it predicted it all in advance, without the password. Ah! But you can read the code yourself, Meno. It is too late for you to say the opposite of
  It wants a password.
But maybe you can just study the code, Meno, and figure out what the next thing is that it will predict from you. For example, maybe after you enter the password, the program will predict you will say "It wants a password" and then "You win, Socrates." You have already said "It wants a password", but you still have time to say "You lose, Socrates," and defy the prediction. What's the matter Meno? Can't you figure out from the code what the password is, or at least what it would do after you enter the password? Is there something wrong with the program, Meno?
Meno: It's encrypted.
Socrates: You really do surprise me, Meno, and I bow to your ingenuity. Well, if the code is encrypted, then I suppose you cannot study it to see what it would predict upon receiving the right password. If you could decrypt it, you could study it, and you could have seen it would predict you would say,
  It wants a password.
  It's encrypted.
And even though it was too late to say the opposite of "It wants a password," still, you could have said the opposite of "It's encrypted", if you could only have decrypted it. Well, Meno, it seems you have no choice now. You must enter the password, and we shall see what your program predicted. So then! Meno! Tell me! What is the password?
Meno: I don't know any password, Socrates.
Socrates: Thank you, Meno! I should have guessed a devious mind like yours would have come up with such a self-referential password. So! The password, in your own words, dear Meno, is:
  I don't know any password, Socrates.
Enter it, then, and if your wisdom is as great as you have demonstrated to me already, then I think as soon as you enter that password, your program will say:
  it wants a password.
  it's encrypted.
  I don't know any password, Socrates.
But now I must leave you, Meno, for I have an appointment at the courthouse.
