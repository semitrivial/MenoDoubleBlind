***Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
Socrates: Good morning to you, Meno, my friend.
Meno: [I've been|I was] [wanting|meaning] to talk [to|with] you.
Socrates: [And [just ]what|What] [would you like|do you want] to talk about[, [[my ]dear ]friend]?
Meno: [It concerns|It's about] [what|something] you said[ to me] [the ]last time [we|you and I] spoke[ together].
Socrates: [I [suppose|reckon] you mean|You mean[,]] when I [told you|argued|suggested] that learning is really [just|just the same as|no different than] remembering?
Meno: [Yes, [and ]t|Yes, T]hat we [actually ][know everything already|already know everything], and [we ]merely [recall|remember] it.
Socrates: [And ]I suppose you've [come up with|invented|contrived|discovered] some [[sort|kind] of ]paradox [or something ]to [try and ][disprove [it|that]|prove it wrong]?
Meno: Quite. Once we finish this [delightful ][discussion|conversation] [we're|we are] [having|currently having|having right now], don't you think [that then ][I will|I'll] know [all ]the [various ]things we [will have ]said[ in it]?
Socrates: You mean, know the conversation?
Meno: [Right|Yes|Exactly|Precisely]. [After|Once|As soon as] [we're [done|finished]|we [finish|part ways]], [I'll|I will|I shall] [then ]know [everything|what] we said. [That is|In other words], [I will|I shall|I'll] [have learned it|then have learned it][, [wouldn't|don't] you [say|think|agree]?|.]
Socrates: I'm not [really ][so ][sure|certain] [about|of] that[, Meno]. [I often|More often than not, I] [find|realize] I misremember conversations, or, [what's|even] worse, when I think [that ]I remember [them ]and understand them, [and then ]it [later |eventually |sometimes |][turns out|happens] [that ]I [either]remember wrong, or understand wrong. Besides[ that], [your question|this question of yours] makes me [a little ][uneasy|nervous], for I feel as if I am in danger of falling into a trap somehow.
Meno: What! Does the great Socrates have trouble with his [memory|memories]?
Socrates: [I often|Quite often I] wish [that ]I [[could remember|remembered] things better|had [better|greater] memory], Meno. For I feel sometimes as though I [flit|flitter] between two [different ]worlds. [The one|The first|One] is [intelligible and beautiful|beautiful and intelligible], [and |while |]the other is [sensuous and profane|profane and sensuous]. For [example|instance], when my house is well organized, [and|so|so that] I remember where I [have ]put [everything|my things], [it's|it is] as if I [live|dwell] in a house [designed|created|built] by the geometers, for I can find my shirt [or|and] my shoes by an act of pure [thinking|thought]. But [more often|most of the time], [[unfortunately|alas|sadly|I'm sad to say|it pains me to say|I'm afraid], [oh Meno, ]]my house is [not [so ]|less well ]organized, and I must [grope|scrounge] around for my shirt [or|and] [my ]shoes, [and I feel ]as if [I'm|I've been] cast out [of|from] that house of the geometers, and [plunged into|[imprisoned|trapped] [in|inside|within]] a carnal house of the [five ]senses.
Meno: Well, [I, for one,|as for me, I] take [great ]pride in my house [always being|being always] [well ]organized. [That's easy, for|For] I [have|employ] servants [who|to] [keep it organized|organize it|keep it in order] for me. And, look here: I have a servant [writing|inscribing] this [very ]conversation [of ours ]on a stone tablet. You know him[, Socrates]: [he|it] is the same boy [you [conversed|spoke] with|with whom you [spoke|conversed]] about geometry the last time you visited. [You know ]I treasure your words [as highly as|like] gold, Socrates, and I will preserve them, and guard them, [just as|just like|the same way] I would [guard|treat] a [great|valuable|priceless] treasure.
Socrates: You flatter me very greatly, Meno. But I suspect you're just saying that because you want to catch me in some trap. Very well, Meno. For the sake of the argument, I grant that after we have this conversation, you shall have learned it.
Meno: Well then, doesn't that mean [that ]I already [know|knew] it, and [have only|had only|needed only|only needed|only had|only have] to [remember|recall][ it]?
Socrates: Yes, I grant that, Meno. [Even|Long] before [you were born|your mother gave birth to you], you already knew I would say[ the words][,] 'Yes, I grant that, Meno,' [which I [said|uttered|spoke] ]just [now|a [second|moment] ago].
Meno: Well then, [dear ]Socrates, [I have|I propose|[I'd like|I want] to [pose|propose]] a challenge for you. [With|Using] your [in]famous method of [questioning|asking questions], please [help|guide] me to [remember|recall] [all [of ]the things|everything] [[we're|we are] going to|we will|we'll|we shall] say in this dialogue[ we're having| we're engaged in]. That is, if [you are able to|you can]. But I doubt [it|you can[ do it]].
Socrates: [Why|And why] do you doubt I can do it, [[my ]dear ]Meno?
Meno: Because [as soon as|the [very ][instant|moment|second]] you help me remember [the things|what] we're going to [say to|tell] [each other|one another], I [shall|will] immediately remember what line I [will ]say next, and I will say the very opposite.***
Socrates: That's very clever, Meno. Let me see if I understand right. So if I help you [recall|remember] what [things ]we're [about to|going to] [say to|tell] [each other|one another], and [then |thus|]you [recall|remember][, for [example|instance],] that in [response|reply] to my [thus |so |][helping|guiding|leading|teaching|directing] you, you [are [next ]going to|will next|will then] say 'Thank you Socrates,' then, [knowing that|with that knowledge|armed with that knowledge], you will [instead ][deliberately|purposefully] [say|defy that prediction by saying][,] 'No thank you, Socrates'?
Meno: Exactly. Or suppose that you help me remember all the things we're going to say, and as a part of that, in particular, I [then ]remember that [as soon as|the instant|the moment] [you finish|you're finished|you're done] thus [helping|guiding] me, I will [then ]say 'You win, Socrates!' [And then|Then], [instead of|rather than] saying 'You win, Socrates!', I will say, 'You lose, Socrates!' Nor will I be lying, [because|for] my very [act of my ]saying 'You lose, Socrates!' will [[prove|demonstrate|show|be proof]|be the [proof|demonstration]] that you [did indeed lose|lost|failed], [because|for] if the memory you [made|helped] me remember was accurate, I would have [instead ]said 'You win.'
Socrates: But what if I help you [remember|recall] [all ]the things [we're|we are] going to say, and, [as a part of that, ]in particular, you [remember|recall] that as soon as I finish thus [helping|assisting] you, you will say, 'You lose, Socrates!' Then, according to your [plan|scheme|strategy|stratagem], you will say the opposite, which is, 'You win, Socrates!' [Wouldn't|Won't] I then have won, by your own admission[?|, Meno?]
Meno: No, [Socrates|my friend]. The [purpose|point] of this challenge is not for you to [make me|get me to] [say|utter] the [words|phrase], "You win, Socrates!" Rather, the purpose [of this challenge ]is for you to guide me [to remember|toward remembering] what [I am|I'm] going to say, whether [that's|that be] "You lose, Socrates!" or "You win, Socrates!", it doesn't matter. And when I [deliberately|intentionally] say the [precise |exact |very |]opposite of what I remember I was going to say[ next]; [and ]then you [shall |will |]lose the challenge, [Socrates|my good Socrates|my friend], whether [that|my deliberate] opposite statement [is|be] "You win, Socrates!" or "You lose, Socrates!"
***Socrates: Very well. This is [a fun|an interesting] challenge. [And ]I think if I'm to have any hope at [succeeding|winning], I will need to resort to computer programming.
Meno: [Perhaps|Maybe so]. For [this|my] [challenge ][is [obviously|clearly]|does seem[ somehow]] related to [things like|such things as] the recursion theorem [and|or] the incompleteness theorem. But even computer programming won't rescue you from my paradox.***
Socrates: We'll see. But if I do succeed [at|in] this [challenge|task], [that|it] would be quite impressive, [wouldn't it|don't you think|don't you agree]?
Meno: [Certainly|Indubitably|Quite].
Socrates: And the reason it would be impressive is because I helped you predict the very future, right?
Meno: Yes.
Socrates: [And would|Would] it be equally impressive if I helped you [to ]remember the past? For [example|instance], if I [helped|were to help] you [remember|recall] that you [began|started] this [whole ][conversation|discussion] by saying 'Good morning, Socrates'?
Meno: No.
Socrates: Well then, by Olympus, wouldn't it at least be impressive if I helped you remember a large amount of the past? For [example|instance], if I helped you [to remember|to recall|remember] this [whole|entire|whole entire] conversation from 'Good morning, Socrates,' all the way up to 'Well then, by Olympus'? [Wouldn't that be|Would that not be] impressive?
Meno: No.
Socrates: So what you've said in the past is, in [some|a certain] sense, trivial[ and unimpressive]?
Meno: [Yes|Quite trivial|Most trivial][, Socrates].
Socrates: But what you'll say in the future is deep and mysterious?
Meno: Yes.
Socrates: And if I tried to invoke something deep and mysterious, then that would be cheating, right? For [example|instance], [if I said|were I to say], 'You [are next going to say|will next say] the thing that you [are next going to say|will next say],' that would [certainly ]not be impressive, would it?
Meno: That would be [most|quite] unimpressive.
Socrates: But if I [invoked|were to invoke] something trivial, that would be fine, right? For example, [if|say|let's say], [as part of|through] my questioning, I remind you [that ]we are standing in Athens, that would be [perfectly ]reasonable, [right|wouldn't it]?
Meno: [Of course|Perfectly reasonable].
***Socrates: So for example, suppose I ask you: take the first sentence you said to me, and repeat it to me again[ right now], and then [afterward|after that], please repeat it to me [again ]a second time. And suppose I [claimed|asserted] that, by [doing so|so doing], you would recite our [entire|whole] conversation. Would I be right?***
Meno: [Absolutely|Certainly|Assuredly] not.
Socrates: [Why not|Well, why not]?
Meno: Well, suppose I did exactly [what you propose|that]. Then [I would|I'd] say: 'Good morning, Socrates. Good morning, Socrates.'
Socrates: [Well, [wouldn't that be|isn't that]|Wouldn't that be|Isn't that] a conversation? Albeit, a [bit|little] one sided?
Meno: It would be a [very ]short[,| and] one sided conversation.
Socrates: But [I would|I'd] be wrong [when I claimed|to claim] that [that ]brief conversation was [our|this] [entire|whole] conversation we are having?
Meno: [Absolutely|Most|Quite] wrong.
Socrates: Why?
Meno: Well, for one[ thing], at the start of this conversation [we're|we are] having, I did not greet you twice in a row like that. For another[ thing], you [responded|replied] to me, [whereas|but] in the [one sided|brief] conversation in question, you [did not|didn't][ respond[ to me]].
***Socrates: So the reason [why ]this supposed one sided conversation would not win [your|the] challenge, is because of the content of the results?
Meno: [Yes|Indeed|Quite so].
Socrates: [And is|Is] there any other reason why this supposed one sided conversation would not [win|beat] your challenge?
Meno: No.
Socrates: In that one sided example, I used earlier pieces of our conversation as tools. But you say, the [lone|only|sole] reason [why ]that example [would fail|failed] to solve the challenge, is [because of|due to] the content[s] of the resulting one sided conversation?
Meno: That's right.
Socrates: Then it's perfectly alright for me to use earlier pieces of our conversation [like that|that way]?***
Meno: [Certainly|Yes, that's [certainly ][fine|alright]].
Socrates: Well, [supposing|suppose] I [said to|instructed] you: 'Take [our|this] [whole|entire|whole entire] conversation up until I said the word octopus. Repeat that whole conversation back to me. Then repeat that whole conversation back to me a second time.' Would that [solve|[be|give] a solution to] your challenge?
Meno: [Not at all|Certainly not|Of course not|Obviously not|Absolutely not|Decidedly not].
Socrates: Because the content[s] of the resulting conversation would [not [equal|be equal to]|be unequal to] [our|the] actual conversation?
Meno: Yes. [For example|As an example], in the resulting conversation, you would say: '...up until I said the word octopus.' [And then|Then], [because|since] at that point [I would|I'd] [have finished|be done with] the first repetition and it would be time [for|[for me ]to start in on] the second one, I would say: 'Good morning, Socrates.'
Socrates: Whereas, in [our|the] [actual|true|real] conversation, [after|when] I said the [word octopus|"octopus"], you did not immediately [say|respond|answer|follow up with] 'Good morning, Socrates'?
Meno: [Yes|Right|That's right].
Socrates: Then we shall have to think of a more clever method. But first, let's consider the example more [deeply|closely]. Let X denote our [whole|entire] conversation up until, and including, when I said [the word octopus|"octopus"]. [And suppose|Suppose] I wanted [to ask ]you to repeat X to me, and then to repeat X to me a second time. [Can|Could] you [program|write] a function that would take X and repeat it that way?
Meno: Certainly[. T|, t]hat['s| would be] easy. How about [this|the following]?
  def repeat_twice(X):
    print(X)
    print(X)
Socrates: So[ then,] if I [asked|instructed] you to take the first [sentence|line] you [said to me|greeted me with], and plug it [in to|into] [this ]'repeat_twice'[ function], [the resulting output would|would the [result|output]] be as follows?
  Good morning, Socrates.
  Good morning, Socrates.
Meno: [That's right|Yes|Quite so].
Socrates: [And w|What] if I asked you to take the nineteenth sentence you said to me, and plug that into 'repeat_twice'? What would [be the result|the result be]?
Meno: [I'm afraid ]I [can't|cannot|don't|do not] remember exactly what that nineteenth sentence was.
Socrates: [Can|Can't] you think of [any|some] way [of [recalling it|reminding yourself]|we could recall it]?
Meno: [Well, y|Y]es. We could [read it [from|in|off [from|of]]|[look it up|look for it] in] my servant boy's tablet here. He's been diligently writing down this conversation for me. You know I [treasure|value] your words more than gold, Socrates.
Socrates: I [should|must] warn you not to read[ or write] too much philosophy, [Meno|my dear friend]. For you cannot [question|ask questions of] a book, [and ]neither can [a|the] book question you. But in this case I admit it's convenient. You say [that ]by consulting [this|your servant's] tablet, we can recall [exactly|precisely] what the nineteenth sentence you said was?
Meno: [Yes|Indeed|That's right|Easily|With ease].
***Socrates: But isn't your servant writing [some ]other things here? Look. He writes 'Meno:' [whenever|when] you begin [talk|speak]ing. He writes 'Socrates:' [whenever|when] I [do|talk|speak].
Meno: [Yes|Sure].
Socrates: We [|may |might ]have [ourselves ]a [very ][serious|grave] problem, then. Look [here on the tablet|at the tablet right here], [near|right near] the [very ]top. It says: 'Good morning to you, Meno, my friend. Meno:' Now I can't remember. Did I say 'Meno:' immediately after I said 'Good morning to you, Meno, my friend'? Or [rather, ]does 'Meno:' here mean that you [started|began] talking?***
Meno: I believe it means [that ]I started talking. I [don't think|[highly |really ]doubt] you literally said 'Meno, my friend, Meno'.
Socrates: But look [right ]here, near the bottom[ of [the|our|your] tablet]. It says, [quote|and I quote]: Did I say 'Meno:' immediately after I said 'Good morning to you, Meno, my friend'? End quote. Well[,] then[.|!|...] I[ know|'m sure| understand] it was [me|I] who said 'Did I say', but [then ]who said 'immediately'? [Which one is it? ]Did Socrates say, 'Did I say Meno: immediately after...'? Or did I [merely ]say 'Did I say' and then [at that point ]Meno [jumped in|interrupted[ me]] [and said|to say] 'immediately after'?
Meno: I'm pretty sure you said 'Did I say Meno: immediately after...'
Socrates: But the tablet itself [doesn't|does not] tell us for [certain|sure]?
Meno: I [suppose|guess] it [might not|doesn't].
Socrates: And just think. If you were reading this tablet by your lonesome, you couldn't even ask it whether this 'Socrates:' here means that Meno said 'Socrates:', or whether it means Socrates [started|began] [talking|speaking]. [So|Now] [do ]you see the danger, [then|my friend], of reading too much philosophy?
Meno: [Perhaps|Maybe].
Socrates: And your challenge is quite hopeless. For if I claim to remind you what our whole conversation is, you [won't be able|will be unable] to check [whether|if|whether or not] my claim [is true|holds true]. [For|Because] you can't tell from this tablet who said what when, can you?
Meno: I [suppose|guess] not.
***Socrates: But maybe we can modify the challenge. Do you at least know what is written on the tablet? For [example|instance], that the very first letter [on the tablet ]is [an ]'M'?
Meno: [Yes|Certainly|Indeed].
Socrates: Then maybe instead of helping you to recall our future conversation, I could instead help you to recall the future contents of the tablet. Your little paradox would still [apply|confound me|trap me], [wouldn't it|would it not]?
Meno: [It would|Quite|Absolutely].
Socrates: [And ]I [wouldn't|would not] even [necessarily ]need to help you [recall|remember] my own [future ]contributions to [the|this] tablet, would I? Wouldn't you [say I won|grant me victory] if I could just help you recall your future contributions to the tablet?***
Meno: [I'm not|I don't think I'm] [entirely |quite |]sure what you mean by that, Socrates.
Socrates: [Let me|I shall] give you an example. Suppose I [helped|could help] you to remember that your own future contributions to the tablet would be[ this]:
  Wow!
  You win, Socrates!
And suppose [that ][immediately after|the very [instant|moment|second]|as soon as] I so helped you, you [said|were to say], "Wow!" And [then|next,] suppose [that ]I said, "Do I win, Meno?" [And then|After which] you [then ][said|replied], "You win, Socrates!" In that scenario, would you grant me victory? Even though I did not help you remember my future contributions, namely "Do I win, Meno?", but only your own contributions?
Meno: [I suppose ]I would [grant you|not begrudge you] [the |a |]victory[ in that case| if that were to happen|, if [all[ of] ]that were to happen|], Socrates.
Socrates: [Then|Well,] suppose I [were to ]announce: "Meno's next contribution to the tablet shall be 'You win, Socrates.' Meno: You win, Socrates." [That is to say|In other words], first, I announce that Meno's next contribution on the tablet will be, "You win, Socrates". [And at|At] that [point|moment], I suppose [you would|you'd] [want|try] to [pipe|jump] in and say "You lose, Socrates". But before you have [a chance|the opportunity|the time|a moment][ to do that], I quickly [say|add], "Meno: You win, Socrates". [Wouldn't I|Would I not] [win|be victorious][ then]?
Meno: [|No! |By no means! | Hardly! ]That would be cheating, [Socrates|friend]. You know they say, only a fool puts words in [other people's mouths|someone else's mouth]. We would both know [that ]you had cheated and had not won. And before you say that [someone|somebody] reading this tablet here would think [you had|you'd] won, [because|for] they were confused by your [linguistic|syntactical] trick, the [truth|reality] is, not even a reader of the tablet after the fact would think [that ]you won. And that['s| is] because your challenge is not to help me remember [some small|a little|some minor] [part|piece] of my future contributions to the tablet. [Rather, y|No, y|Y]our challenge is to help me remember [all|the entirety] of my future contributions[ to the tablet], and in the [correct|proper|right] order, [too|as well]. So in that example [of yours|you just gave], after [you say|you've said] "You win, Socrates. Meno: You win, Socrates," I would [then ]say, "You cheat, Socrates." [And t|T]hen even someone reading the tablet[ years later], who [is not|was [not|never]] here in person, [would [still ]know|could [still ][tell|see]] you did not win. Because they would see that I contributed the words, "You cheat, Socrates" to the tablet, [and|whereas] you did not predict those.
Socrates: You are [very |most |][cunning|clever], Meno. I [think not|doubt] even Ulysses could [trick|outsmart] you.
Meno: [Why do you say that|What do you mean by that], Socrates?
***Socrates: Do you remember how Ulysses tricked Polyphemus, the cyclops? He lied to Polyphemus, [he said|saying|claiming] his name was [Noman|"Noman"]. [Then w|W]hen Polyphemus's [friends|neighbors] came and asked if some man [was|were] slaying [him, Polyphemus|Polyphemus, he] [said|shouted|answered][ that], 'Noman is slaying me.' Didn't Ulysses do that on purpose, so that the cyclops's friends would [misunderstand[,]|be misled] and think Polyphemus [had ]said "No man is slaying me"? Isn't that [exactly|just] the [kind|sort|type] of syntactical semantical confusion you have so effortlessly avoided just now?***
Meno: I [guess|suppose|reckon] [it is|so].
Socrates: I think this challenge is [very|quite] difficult, and I almost want to give up, except a [certain ]voice [in|inside] my head compels me not to[ do that]. Certainly this task [is beyond|exceeds] my own power[, and|;] I can only [hope|pray] that it is within your power, Meno. So I will ask you questions[,] and [we will|we'll] [see|find out] whether you [can|have the power to] [figure out how|find a way] to [defeat|conquer] yourself in this challenge, though I daresay you have a conflict of interest[ in the matter| here|]. [Let us|Let's] start [from|at] the beginning. Doesn't the first line on [this|the] tablet say, "Meno: Good morning, Socrates"?
Meno: We've [[quite ]thoroughly |already |]established that.
Socrates: [And i|I]f I [asked you to|requested you] plug that line into your 'repeat_twice' function, would the [result|output] be [the following|as follows]?
  Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
  Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
Meno: [Yes|Yes, [of course|it would[ be]|I believe so]].
Socrates: What if [instead of you, ]a cobbler [were to plug|plugged] that line into [your ]'repeat_twice'? Would the result [then |still ]be the following?
  Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
  Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
Meno: [Again[,] yes|Yes[,] [again|of course]|Of course|Sure|Why not?].
Socrates: [And|Well,] [then ]what if a painter plugged that line into 'repeat_twice'? Would the result [then ]be the following?
  Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
  Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
Meno: [Yes, [it|the result|the output]|[Indeed. |Of course. |Certainly. |][It|The result|The output]] [would [still be so|be the same|not change|still not change]|wouldn't change|wouldn't differ], even if we were painters.
Socrates: And what if a sailor plugged that line into 'repeat_twice'? Would the result be the following?
  Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
Meno: Good morning, Socrates.
Socrates: Hey! Don't you [know|think] it's [impolite|not polite|rude|a bit rude|a little rude|inconsiderate] to finish [someone[ else]|another person|another man]'s sentence for him[ like that]?
Meno: [I'm sorry|Forgive me], Socrates. [It's just that|But] you were being rather [repetitive and ]predictable[ just now].
Socrates: I was [doing that|being that way] on purpose[,] [because|for] I suspected you['d| would] react that way[ eventually]. You see, I [wanted|intended] to [show you|demonstrate] something. Look on [the|your] tablet near the [bottom|end] here, where you finished my sentence for me just now. Don't you think someone could get confused[,] reading this?
Meno: [Quite|Absolutely] confused.
Socrates: So then, reading philosophy from a [tablet|book|tablet, or a book], without [being able|the ability|the chance] to ask [the philosopher questions|questions [to|of] the philosopher], [isn't|is not] [much good|advisable], is it?
Meno: Sure[ it's no good], Socrates, [provided|if|if we assume] the tablet was deliberately [designed|engineered] to be confusing! You know, I'm [almost ]starting to understand why [they|some people] accuse you of corrupting the youth.
Socrates: Meno, that's a ridiculous [rumour|slander]. All [[I have|I've] ever done|I ever did] to the youth is [inspire|motivate|encourage] them to think a little[ bit]. [But|And] anyone can think [anything|whatever] they want, and then turn around and unthink it just as easily.
Meno: [True|Certainly].
Socrates: And all these things we've been saying are [just|mere] idle thoughts, aren't they? You could ponder these things [deeply ]all day and [all ]night, and then the very next [day|morning], you could ponder the exact opposite.
Meno: [You're right|I agree|That's right].
Socrates: [So o|O]ne cannot corrupt the youth[, then,] just by contemplating thoughts together with them. For one can change one's thoughts just as [easily|effortlessly] as one can imagine a mountain [made ]of gold, [don't|wouldn't] you agree?
Meno: [If|When] you put [it|things] [that way|like that], [yes|sure].
Socrates: And changing people's thoughts is like writing Greek on the surface of the water. [For t|T]he water is so pliable[,] you can write on it with your bare finger[s]. But the instant that you've written there, your writing [disappears|vanishes], doesn't it?
Meno: [Yes|Certainly|It does|It certainly does].
***Socrates: In fact, I always assumed that's what Thales meant, when he said[ that] everything is made [out ]of water. He meant that[, in time,] all the impressions we make on [the|this] world fade[| away| out], [just ]as [if|though] we inscribed them on the face of the sea. You could not corrupt the Aegean by writing on its surface, no matter how [scandalous|wicked|scandalous or wicked|scandalous and wicked] the things you wrote [there|on it]. Even [language itself|the language we speak] [changes|slowly changes|gradually changes]. And we [attempt|try] to nail that down, by imposing sharp constraints on it in [our|the form of] poetry.*** But over long enough time, even that fails, and it's like trying to keep the tide from going out by nailing the water to the sand. [In the same way|Likewise|Similarly], [I believe ]you [could never|couldn't ever] corrupt a man just by writing thoughts [into|onto|upon] his mind, Meno.
Meno: But surely you [do|must] admit some corrupt youths exist, don't you, Socrates?
Socrates: [I admit it|I'll admit that].
Meno: [Then|Well,] how [can|could] [any|a] youth be corrupted, if not through his [mind|thoughts]?
Socrates: Youths have [physical ]bodies, too, besides just their minds, [don't|haven't] they?
Meno: [Yes|Of course|Certainly].
Socrates: So to really corrupt the youth, you['d| would] have to corrupt their bodies, not their minds.[ Wouldn't you?]
Meno: [Perhaps|Maybe].
Socrates: And isn't the eye [by far ]the most fragile and sensitive [part of the body|body part]?
Meno: [So it would [appear|seem]|It would [appear|seem] so].
Socrates: [And i|I][sn't|s not] the slightest damage to the eye more [grievous|harmful] than a [violent|terrible] wound [elsewhere|somewhere else] on [the|your] body?
Meno: Within reasonable limits, [yes|sure].
Socrates: So if someone [wanted|were going] to corrupt the youth, they should try to corrupt the eyes of the youth, shouldn't they?
Meno: [Perhaps|Maybe].
***Socrates: And [perhaps|maybe] that's why people think [I'm|I have] [such ]a corrupting influence[,|:] not because of [these|the] words I say, but because of these bulging, bugging eyes I have. And because my eyes bulge out, people [assume|think|fear|worry] their children's eyes will bulge out from talking to me. As if it is not we who converse, but as if our eyes are men conversing [with each other|together]. But no man could convince a person to [deliberately |purposely |intentionally |][harm|hurt|damage] his own eye, [right|surely|could he]?
Meno: No man except [maybe|perhaps] Noman.
Socrates: Then, to corrupt a man's eye, one [would have to|must] trick him into doing something that hurts his eye without him knowing it?***
Meno: I [guess|reckon] so[, Socrates].
Socrates: One would have to persuade him [to do|into doing] something that [damages|hurts] his eye [slowly|gradually]. One would have to [persuade|convince] him to [damage|hurt] his eye in [such a way|some way such] that he didn't even [know|realize] he was [doing so|hurting it]. [Otherwise|Or else|For otherwise|For if not], [the victim|he] would [quickly ]turn against you, wouldn't he?
Meno: Yes, and [he would|he'd] [despise|hate] you[, too].
Socrates: Can you think of any way a man could damage his own eye like that?
Meno: [Well, h|H]e could [stare|gaze] at the sun, Socrates[, [I suppose|if] that's what you're [getting|trying to [get|hint]] at].
Socrates: So [then, ]to corrupt the youth in the most [efficient|reliable|efficient and reliable] way, one should [persuade them to stare|trick them into staring] at the sun?
Meno: Yes. That is, if one [wanted|wants] to corrupt the youth, Socrates. [Not that |Of course n]either of us [would want|wants] that[.|!]
Socrates: But if you [did convince|convinced] a young man to [stare|gaze] at the sun, wouldn't wiser men [come to his rescue|rescue him]? Wouldn't they [tell him|say], 'Stop! You [must not|mustn't] stare at the sun! It will [surely ][make you go blind|blind you]!'?
Meno: [Yes|Indeed].
***Socrates: And so in order [for your diabolical plan to work|that your diabolical plan should work][ properly], [you would|you'd] have to anticipate that, [wouldn't you|would you not]? Much like[| how| the way in which] we're trying to anticipate Meno here. You'd have to not just persuade your young victim [that ]he should gaze at the sun, but even predict [that ]his elders [would|will] [tell him|say] 'Stop!' [And y|Y]ou'd have to make him think his elders were [wrong|mistaken], wouldn't you?
Meno: [There would|There'd] be no other way[ to do it].
Socrates: But he loves his elders[!|.] [He would|He'd] never believe they would intentionally [lie to|mislead|deceive] him. You'd have to convince him his elders meant [the best|well], [but|and] that they themselves [were|had been] deceived.
Meno: [I suppose y|Y][ou'd|ou would] have to.
Socrates: You'd have to convince him [that ]they're like men in a cave, [staring at|watching] shadows on the wall. [And t|T]hat the sun is a fire behind them, casting those shadows. [And t|T]hat their eyes [are|have grown] accustomed to the dark, and [that ]in order to escape[ the cave], they must turn and face the sun, wouldn't you?***
Meno: [That would be|That is|That'd be] one way to do it.
Socrates: [W|And [then ]w]hen their elders cried, 'Stop!', they would [say|think] to themselves: 'These elders [don't|do not] realize [we're|we are] in a cave. They [believe|think] this fire is the sun, and it will burn [up ]my pupils.' Wouldn't they?
Meno: That would be our [strategy|stratagem], yes.
Socrates: And if some youth [ever ]returned to [that|the] cave, after dwelling [on the bright surface|in the bright outside], they really would be [quite ]blind, while their eyes [|re]adjusted to the darkness, wouldn't they?
Meno: Quite blind[, yes| indeed|].
Socrates: [And t|T]heir elders would [say|lament], 'You should have listened to us! We [warned|told] you you would go blind if you stared at the sun[ like that]! [Oh, i|I]f only you had [listened|heeded us]!'
Meno: Yes, [and ]their [poor ]elders would be [quite|most] [upset|distraught].
Socrates: [W|And w]hat would happen to whoever [it was that ]told that youth to turn and face the fire[ in the cave]? He'd be accused of corrupting the youth, [wouldn't he|would he not]?
Meno: At the very [least|minimum].
Socrates: Because the youth's eyes were damaged? Or because of [the ]thoughts in the youth's [mind|head]?
Meno: Because the youth's eyes were damaged, [obviously|clearly|of course].
Socrates: So then, [there's|there is] [no|very little] [danger|risk] [[that ]I'll corrupt|of [me|my] corrupting] you, Meno, merely by making you [think about|contemplate] lines of text [|written |inscribed ]on a tablet, is there?
Meno: None[ at all| whatsoever|].
Socrates: [Then|In that case,] let's proceed. For[,] the last thing I [would|should] ever want to do to you is [to ]corrupt you, Meno.
Meno: [Please do|Yes], Socrates, let's get back to the issue at hand. [Don't|I don't want you to] [dodge|evade] my challenge by [going off on|pursuing|chasing after] some wild tangent. [Let me|I'll] remind you of your precarious position. You claimed, [the ]last time we met, that [there is|there's] no such thing as learning, rather, there is only remembering. I [have ]pointed out that by that logic, I already know all the contents of this [conversation|discussion] [we're|we are] [having|engaged in]. And [I have|I've] challenged you to help me remember those contents. And [now ][you're|you are] stuck[ hard], for [if|should] you succeed in this [challenge|task], I shall immediately say the [[very|exact|precise] |]opposite of what you help me remember I was about to say[ next].
Socrates: Thank you, [my ]dear Meno, for holding me accountable.
Meno: Let's get on with it, then.
Socrates: Yes, [we must|let's] proceed. Well, [then, ]suppose instead of handing you the first line of this conversation as X, suppose I handed you the [whole|entire|whole entire] conversation as X, up until [when ]I said 'Yes, we must proceed'. [And s|S]uppose I wanted [your function to|that your function should] output the first five characters[ of X]. What [then ]would it output?
Meno: It would output 'Meno:'
Socrates: [[And|Well,] w|W]hat if I wanted [your function|it] to output the first ten characters?
Meno: [Then i|I]t would output 'Meno:Goodm'.
Socrates: [[And|Well,] w|W]hat would that function [be|look like], that outputs [the|those] first ten characters?
Meno: It would be [like ]this:
  def output_first_ten(X):
    print(X{:10})
***Socrates: But look here. There's [some|a] space on your servant's tablet between 'Meno:' and 'Good'. [If|And if] someone included that space in the X [that ]they [handed|passed] [to ]you, then your [function|output_first_ten] would not output 'Meno:Goodm'[; rather,|, [but ]rather] it would output 'Meno: Good', wouldn't it?
Meno: [Yes|That's right|It would].
Socrates: [[Can|Could] you modify [your|the] function|[Can|Could] your function be modified] to [discard|ignore] [all|any] such spaces? [We'd better|You'd better modify it to] [discard|ignore] tabs and linebreaks [too|as well],[ while we're at it,] and also hypthens, [since|as] I see your servant sometimes inserts [a hyphen|hyphens] [if|when] a line of text ends in the middle of a word.***
Meno: Sure. Here's the modified version:
  def output_first_ten_[no[_]space[s]|without_space[s]](X):
    X=X.replace(" ","") # Remove spaces
    X=X.replace("\n","") # Remove linebreaks
    X=X.replace("\t","") # Remove tabs
    X=X.replace("-","") # Remove hyphens
    print(X{:10})
Socrates: [[And i|I|Well, i]f|Suppose] [we changed [ten to forty|"ten" to "forty"]|ten were [replaced by|changed [to|into]] forty|we replaced ten with forty], what would your function output[ then]?
Meno: It would output "Meno:Goodmorning,Socrates.Socrates:Goodm".
Socrates: [I|And i]t's [good|a good thing] [that ]we removed [the ]linebreaks, for otherwise [I suppose ][it|the function] would have [output|printed] the following:
  Meno:Goodmorning,Socrates.
  Socrates:Good
And [I think ]that would be [much ][harder|tougher] to [reason about|work with|wrap my head around]. [So ]I think we're making [some ]progress. [We're|We are] not limited to printing fragments of earlier conversation directly, are we? We [could|can] [transform|alter] those fragments first, before printing them, [can't we|right]? For [example|instance], you could write a program that prints the first ten characters of [the|our] [conversation|discussion], but [converted|transformed] [to|into] uppercase. What would the result be?
Meno: [It|The result] would be 'MENO:GOODM'.
Socrates: In that case, could we say that you have taken an initial fragment of our conversation, and you have [transformed|modified] it [in ]a certain way, and[ that] 'MENO:GOODM' [was|is] the [output|result]?
Meno: [Yes|Certainly|That's right].
Socrates: Now as to your challenge, [suppose|imagine] I described a more [elaborate|complicated|sophisticated|intricate] transformation. [[S|And s]uppose|And let's [say|suppose|imagine]] you performed [that|said|my] transformation on [this|our] conversation so far, from the start until the moment when I said "Now as to your challenge". And suppose [that ]the output was:
  You win, Socrates.
  You're welcome.
  I admit it.
[[And|Now] [suppose|imagine]|[Suppose|Imagine]] that [as soon as|once] you performed that transformation[,] and [saw|realized] [[the|its] output|the result], you immediately said, "You win, Socrates." And suppose after that, I said, "Thank you, Meno." And suppose after that, you said, "You're welcome." And suppose [after that|next], I [said|asked], "Do you admit [that ]there is no learning, [there is|but] only remembering?" [And s|S]uppose after that, you [said|answered|replied], "I admit it." Then [wouldn't I have|I would have] [passed|beat] your challenge?
Meno: Yes, but that would never happen.
Socrates: Why not?
Meno: [Because i|I]n that situation, after seeing [said|that] output, which predicts I will say "You win, Socrates", [[I'd|I would] instead say|[I'd|I would] [respond|reply] by saying] the opposite. [I would|I'd] say, "You lose, Socrates". And if[ instead |, instead, ]the output started with "You lose, Socrates", [then ][I would|I'd] say the opposite of that[ instead], [and say|which is|namely], "You win, Socrates", but [we'd|we would] both know [that I was lying, and that ]you [really ]lost.
Socrates: Yes, that's what makes this challenge so [devious|tricky], Meno.
Meno: [Are you ready to give up|Do you give up yet], [Socrates|friend]?
Socrates: It is not I who has the choice to give up or [to ]continue, Meno, it is you. For [I am|I'm] only asking questions, [and ][you are|you're] the one answering[ them]. Indeed, I think that's why this approach [cannot|can't] work. For you are not a book, Meno. You are not just some lines of text. You [do not|don't] choose [[your ]words|words to say] blindly, like someone blind from [sun gazing|staring at the sun]; [rather, ]you [choose|calculate] them in response to things. [And b|B]efore you speak, you consider in your mind what [you are|you're] going to say, [mentally ]performing calculations that are [invisible to|[hidden|veiled] from] me. [And i|I]n the context of computer programming, what do we call [something|a thing] that [acts|does things] that way, [doing|performing] scratchwork [in the background|internally] [in order ]to [calculate|compute] what [it will do|to do] next?
Meno: We call that a program, Socrates.
***Socrates: Well, let us change our approach then. Suppose we [described|contrived|invented] some elaborate transformation. And suppose you [performed|were to perform] that transformation on this conversation[ [so far|we are having]], from the start until [the moment ]when I said, "Well, let us change our approach then." [And s|S]uppose the output [of that ]was:
  print("""You win, Socrates.
  You're welcome.
  I admit it.""")
And suppose that [as soon as|once|the moment|the instant] you [saw|knew|learned|realized] that output, you said, "You win, Socrates," [and I said|to which I replied], "Thank you, Meno," and then you said, "You're welcome," and then I [asked|said], "Do you admit there is no learning, only remembering?" and you answered[,] "I admit it." [Then w|W]ould I [have passed|win] your challenge?***
Meno: [Yes|Certainly|Indeed].
Socrates: Even though what you said [started|began] with "You win, Socrates,"[ and] not with "print"?
Meno: Yes, [for ]in this example [the|your] transformation has not directly produced my [future|next] [conversation lines|lines in the conversation], but rather, a program which produces those lines. I would [not begrudge|grant] you victory [for that|in that case]. But again, [that|it] [can|will] never happen, for the same reason as before, Socrates.
Socrates: What about the following scenario? Suppose we describe [a|some] transformation, and you perform [that|the|said|this] transformation on [our|this] conversation so far, from the start until [the moment ]when I said, "What about the following scenario?" And suppose the output [[to ]be|was]:
  socrates_line = input("Enter Socrates' next line: ")
  if socrates_line == "What do you think?":
    print("I think you win, Socrates.")
  else:
    print("I think you lose, Socrates.")
And [suppose|imagine] [that ][as soon as|once|the moment|the instant] you saw that, I said, "What do you think?", and you [answered|said], "I think you win, Socrates." Would I [then ]have [passed|won] your challenge?
Meno: [Sure|Yes], Socrates. But [[once ]again, ]that would never happen, for the same reason as above.
Socrates: [But w|W]hat if, instead of [my ]saying, "What do you think?", I instead said, "How now, Meno?", and [then ]you said, "I think you lose, Socrates." [Would|Then would] that [qualify for|qualify as|count as] [a ]victory?
Meno: [Yes|Quite].
Socrates: Why?
Meno: Because the transformation produced a program saying how I will respond to you. [Namely, |And] it said that if you next say "What do you think?", I will [say|answer] "I think you win, Socrates." [But|And] [that ]otherwise, [I will|I'll] say, "I think you lose, Socrates." And since you [next ]say, "How now, Meno?", [rather than|as opposed to|which is not the same as|which is different than] "What do you think?", and since I then [say|answer] "I think you lose, Socrates," the prediction was correct.
Socrates: But [I suppose ]that would never happen, [though, ]would it?
Meno: [No|It wouldn't], [because|for] I would [deliberately|intentionally] defy the prediction. If you said, "What do you think?", I would [calculate|already know] that the prediction [was|is] that I [should|will] say "I think you win, Socrates," and I would defy that prediction[,] and say "I think you lose, Socrates." [But|And] if you said, "How now, Meno?", [then ]I would already know that the prediction [is that I will|is for me to] [say|answer|reply] "I think you lose, Socrates," and I would defy that prediction [by saying|and say] "I think you win, Socrates." [But|And] we would both know I was lying, and that you [really ]lost.
Socrates: You have really put me in a bind here, Meno. I fail to see any way [for me to|I could[ possibly]] [win|beat you], unless [perhaps|maybe] some god appears from the air, some Deus ex Machina, [as|like] in the plays [performed|they perform] at the festival[s].
Meno: Do you give up then, Socrates?
Socrates: It feels almost hopeless, but I do have one ray of hope. It is not only me speaking in this [conversation|discussion], but you too, Meno. So I will guide you[ as best as I can] to describe [some|a] transformation like we have talked about, and I [will ][hope|pray] [that ][by some miracle ]our conversation just so happens to be [exactly|precisely] the right conversation that your transformation will transform into a program that predicts you, not through [my wisdom|any wisdom of my own], for I believe I know nothing myself, but through your own mercy and [your own ]wisdom, dear [Meno|friend], [both of ]which so far [exceed|surpass] mine. Tell me, is it [likely|probable] that there [is|could be] some direct cipher which [transforms|will transform] our conversation into a [good ][computer ]program? For [example|instance], suppose the transformation [says to|prescribes that we should] take our conversation and change every "a" to "b", and [change ]every "c" to "d", and so on, and [finally ]change every "z" into "a". Is it at all [likely|probable] [that ][this|such a] [simple ]transformation [would|could] turn our conversation into a program that predicts you?
Meno: It would be a[n absolute| complete|] miracle if [that|such a simple] transformation [turned|could turn] our conversation into any valid program at all, Socrates. I'm [almost|nearly|practically|quite] certain it would produce [pure|complete] [gibberish|nonsense]. Indeed, our conversation start[s|ed] with "Meno:Goodmorning,Socrates." [T|So t]hat [trivial ]cipher you just proposed would yield an output starting with "Nfop:Hppenpsojoh,Tpdsbufs." I doubt any computer program starts [like that|that way]. Much less one [good|ingenious] enough to predict me!
***Socrates: [Perhaps|Maybe|I guess] the problem is that a haystack can't be made entirely [out ]of needles, and if our conversation does secretly hide some [computer ]program that predicts you, [I suppose ]many characters [from|of] the conversation must [join|unite|work] together to hide each character [in|of] the program. [Perhaps|Maybe] every five characters [in|from] our conversation [could ][hide|be used to [generate|compute|derive]] one character [of|in] [the|our] desired program. For [example|instance], [maybe|perhaps] the [correct|right] cipher, [instead of|rather than] changing "a" into "b", changes "Meno:" into "p", and changes "Goodm" into "r", and changes "ornin" into "i", and changes "g,Soc" into "n", and changes "rates" into "t", so that, [altogether|together], the first 25 [characters|letters] [of|in|from] [our|the] conversation [get [changed|transformed] into|become] "print". Do you think that's at all [likely|probable]?***
Meno: It's more [likely|probable] than it was [before|with the previous cipher], but only marginally. It would still be [quite ]a miracle if it worked, only slightly less [of a miracle|so]. [[I'm sure|I would think] f|F]ive to one is still [far|way] too many needles and too little hay, Socrates.
Socrates: [Then w|W|Well, w]ould ten characters of conversation per [every ]one character of program [suffice|be enough]? [I mean|That is|That is to say], could our cipher transform[, say,] "Meno:Goodm" into "p", and "orning,Soc" into "r", and so on?
Meno: I'm [fairly |pretty |][sure|certain] ten to one is still too little hay, Socrates.
Socrates: Well then, how many characters of conversation do you think would be [enough|sufficient|adequate], to encode one character of this [elusive ]program we are [looking|groping around] for?
Meno: [I don't really know|I'm not really sure]. I [suppose|guess] it [depends|must depend] on [the size of the alphabet used|how big the alphabet is that we use] [to write|in writing|for writing] the program.
***Socrates: You mean, if programs were written with a larger alphabet, then we would need more characters of conversation [per|for every] character of the hidden program?
Meno: [Yes|That's right|Exactly|Precisely].
Socrates: Then [I guess ]since we [don't have|haven't got] [all|the whole] day to [just ]stand here [talking|conversing], [we should|let's] agree to write this desired program [with|using] [the smallest|as small [of ]an] alphabet as [possible|we can]. We should ask ourselves[,|:] which characters are absolutely essential for writing [computer programs|a computer program]? Within reason, [I mean|that is]. [After all, w|W]e're not trying to compete in some obfuscated code contest.
Meno: I [think|suppose] a reasonable alphabet for [writing|computer] programs[, without too many characters], [would|might] be:
  alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
  alphabet += " (){}:'=,+.#\n"
  alphabet += '"'***
Socrates: [That's f|F]orty characters in all, right? [Since|For|As] I assume by \n you mean a linebreak[, which is [one single|just one] character]. [And n|N]o uppercase letters[, like "A", "B", [|or |and ]"C"]?
Meno: For your sake, Socrates, I [will|shall] [consider|deem] it a victory for you if our program predicts [I will|I'll] say "hey", all lowercase, even if my servant here actually writes "Hey" with the H uppercase.
Socrates: Most generous of you, Meno. [Well then|Very well], [assuming|if we assume] [that ]this [rather ]barebones [forty letter ]alphabet[ of yours] is rich enough to write computer programs, how many [characters|letters] [from|of] our conversation should we use to encode each character of our program? We already saw that "one", "five", and "ten" are too [small|few]. [Perhaps|Maybe] twenty[ then]?
Meno: Socrates, I know you [haven't|never] studied computer science, but really. Twenty[ is|'s] still way too [small|few]. You're [probably ]still off by [an|a whole] order of magnitude[, so l|. L]et's make it two hundred.
***Socrates: [Alright|Very well then|Very good then], 200 it shall be. So [then, ]every 200 characters of our conversation [shall|will] hide[ within them] [a|one] single character of a computer program. Alright then, how would you define the cipher? It [should|must] take a string of 200 characters from our [conversation|tablet][,] and convert that string into a single character from [your 40 letter alphabet|that 40 letter alphabet you defined earlier].***
Meno: Let me think, Socrates. Hmm[m|mm|].[..] Well, there's a convenient function [called|named] "ord" [which turns|for turning] characters into numbers. For [example|instance], ord("a") is 97, ord("b") is 98, ord("+") is 43, and so on. Don't [worry|fret] about [those|the] [exact|specific] numbers, this "ord" function is built into my programming language[ (Python)|, Python]. [As|Since] [our conversation|[the|our] tablet] has quotation marks and my servant sometimes writes those [as|with|using] fancy unicode quotes, [in order|I guess] to be safe we should consider all the quotes[ in our conversation] to be plain ASCII quotes, just like we delete all the [spaces and linebreaks and tabs|spaces, linebreaks, and tabs] in [the|our] conversation. [And|These] plain ASCII quotes[ have [the following ords|ords as follows]|' ords are as follows]: for the single quote, ord("'")[=| is ]39[;|, and] for the double quote, ord('"')=34. [Using|With] this ord function, we can [systematically ]turn characters into numbers, add up those numbers, and [then ]take the remainder [after dividing the sum by|of the sum upon division by] the length[|, 40,|(40)] of [our chosen|my program] alphabet. [In other words|That is to say], if the sum [comes to|is] 40 or higher, [then ]smash it down into the range from 0 to 39, so it can be used as the index of a character in our alphabet. [If we write|Writing] [it all|all that] [in|as] [[computer ]code|a function]:
  def cipher(X):
    total = sum(ord(character) for character in X)
    remainder = total % len(alphabet)
    return alphabet{remainder}
This function [works|will work] [for|on] inputs X of any length. Of course [it's|it is] [mainly ]intended [for|to be used [on|for|with]] inputs X [of|with] length 200.
Socrates: [Just t|T]o [make|be] sure I understand [everything|right|everything right], what would be the value of, say, cipher("Meno:")?
Meno: Well, ord("M") is 77, ord("e") is 101, ord("n") is 110, ord("o") is 111, and ord(":") is 58. Add those up and you get 457. Now, the length of [the|our|my] alphabet is 40. If [you|we] divide 457 by 40, the [result|answer] is 11[,] [with|plus] a remainder of 17. So the index we get is 457 % 40 = 17. So cipher("Meno:") is alphabet{17}, character number 17 in our alphabet, [counting|remembering to count] from zero. [Which is|Namely,|Namely:] "r". [So at last|Altogether], cipher("Meno:")="r".
***Socrates: [Amazing|Wonderful|Astounding|Astonishing], Meno, [you must r|r]emind me someday to introduce you to my friend Timaeus. And what do we get when we take the first 200 characters [of|from] [our|this] conversation and plug them into [this|our|your] cipher?
Meno: [If we take|Taking] the first 200 characters [of|from] our conversation, they make the following string, though I [worry|believe|fear] my servant will insert linebreaks because [otherwise ][this long string|it] won't fit in [one|a] [single ]row on his tablet, so please ignore [those|the] linebreaks[;|, but] anyway, the [200 ]characters are:
  Meno:Goodmorning,Socrates.Socrates:Goodmorningtoyo
  u,Meno,myfriend.Meno:I'vebeenwantingtotalktoyou.So
  crates:Andjustwhatwouldyouliketotalkabout,mydearfr
  iend?Meno:It'saboutwhatyousaidthelasttimeyouandIsp
[[If|When] we plug|Plugging] this [length 200|long] string into [the|our|my] cipher function, [and ]remembering not to include [the ]linebreaks, we get "#".***
Socrates: And what about the next 200 characters?
Meno: The next 200[ characters], [in other words|that is|that is to say], characters [number ]200 through 399, for computers [start counting from zero|count from zero|count starting from zero], [are|would be][| the following| as follows| these]:
  oketogether.Socrates:IsupposeyoumeanwhenItoldyouth
  atlearningisreallyjustremembering?Meno:Yes,andthat
  weactuallyknoweverythingalready,andwemerelyremembe
  rit.Socrates:AndIsupposeyou'vecontrivedsomesortofp
[And w|W]e can be [|reasonably |fairly |pretty ][sure|confident] [we [haven't|have not] [made [a|any] mistake|erred]|this is [right|correct]], [because|for] the conversation flows [seemlessly|naturally] from the first 200 characters into the second 200 characters, you see? The first 200 characters ended [with|in] "sp", and the next 200[ characters] [begin|start] with "oke", and [putting that together|together that] makes "spoke". [If|When] we plug these 200 characters into our cipher function, we get "t".
Socrates: So the [computer ]program [we are|we're] [looking|searching] for [begins|must begin] with "#t", is that [right|correct]?
Meno: [That's [right|correct]|Yes][.|, Socrates.]
Socrates: Meno, do you think it's possible "#t" could be the [beginning|start] of a valid [computer ]program?
Meno: Well, Socrates, [any|a] line starting with "#" is [what's known as ]a comment, [which is ]meant for the human reader[ [of the program ]to read], not for the machine itself[ to [run|execute]]. The program could start with a comment, [like|such as] "#predict meno" or "#generate meno's next lines," or [really any comment|any other comment] that [starts|begins] with a "#t"[; i|. I][t's|t is] [just|only] a comment, [so ]it has no effect on [what the program ultimately produces|the program's ultimate output in the end]. So I [guess|suppose] it is at least possible that "#t" could be the start of a program.
***Socrates: By Zeus! Alright, Meno, keep going. Plug in all the length 200 blocks from our conversation, stopping with the first block in which I say "By Zeus!" Do we get a valid program?
Meno: One minute... No, but I am shocked, for the output does resemble a computer program, but it has all kinds of errors. Here it is, note the double space between the "n" and the "r" on line 3:
  #trojn hrse
  seed(p=askpword())
  z,x=", yo ooned","""n  r''s'
  iati.idnet'pas'r.p(se)d nt yap'o
  +twspcw'tr"""
  c=jn(smpl(p,z.len
  shfl(d=rng(x.len
  if c==z:exec(jn(x.i:i in d
Socrates: You say it has errors? Can we repair it? Tell me, what's the first error you notice?***
Meno: The first line is spelled wrong. The comment should be "#Trojan Horse".
Socrates: I assume that's not the only error. Repair that. What's the next error?
Meno: The last three lines are missing two closing right parentheses each.
Socrates: If you repair that, what's the next error?
Meno: This code defines variables inside parentheses, as if the author were writing C instead of Python. For example, the line "seed(p=askpword())" should be two lines: "p=askpword()", then "seed(p)".
Socrates: Go ahead and repair that line. I see the same error in the definition of "d" in the penultimate line. Repair that, too. Are there any other errors?
Meno: The functions "seed", "smpl", and "shfl" are undefined.
Socrates: Does any library have those? Maybe we can import them.
Meno: Not by those exact names. Wait! The "random" library has "seed", "sample", and "shuffle", that must be what's meant. I'll insert a line "import random" right below the Trojan horse comment. And I'll change "seed" to "random.seed", "smpl" to "random.sample", and "shfl" to "random.shuffle".
Socrates: Any other errors?
Meno: "z.len" should be "len(z)" and "x.len" should be "len(x)".
Socrates: Anything else?
Meno: The expression "x.i:i in d" should clearly be "x[i] for i in d". It's like someone confused Python comprehensions with mathematical set notation.
Socrates: Anything else?
Meno: It looks like "rng" should be the standard function "range". And I think "jn" should be '"".join'.
Socrates: Anything else?
Meno: In modern Python, "range(len(x))" should be "list(range(len(x)))".
Socrates: Once you fix all that, are there any more errors?
Meno: Just one. This function "askpword" is undefined.
Socrates: Could the name be short for something?
Meno: Maybe "ask_password". I'll replace that line with "p=input('Enter the password: ')".
***Socrates: What's the program now, with all the errors fixed?
Meno: Here you go:
  #Trojan Horse
  import random
  p=input('Enter the password: ')
  random.seed(p)
  z,x=", yo ooned","""n  r''s'
  iati.idnet'pas'r.p(se)d nt yap'o
  +twspcw'tr"""
  c="".join(random.sample(p,len(z)))
  d=list(range(len(x)))
  random.shuffle(d)
  if c==z:exec("".join(x[i] for i in d))
Socrates: Run it! What does it predict? I understand you plan to say the opposite. What's wrong? You are quiet. Is there some problem with your program?
Meno: It wants a password.
Socrates: You're in a bind, for until you enter the password, you won't know what it will say once you enter it. Maybe when you enter the password, it will say, "It wants a password." It's too late to say the opposite of "It wants a password." Maybe studying the code, you can figure out the next prediction, and defy the oracle. What's wrong? Can't you analyze the code to determine the next prediction?
Meno: It's encrypted.
Socrates: Then you must enter the password, and we shall see what your program predicted. Meno! Tell me! What is the password?
Meno: I don't know any password, Socrates.
Socrates: The password, in your own words, is: "I don't know any password, Socrates." Enter that, and if your wisdom is as great as I believe, I think your program will print:
  it wants a password.
  it's encrypted.
  I don't know any password, Socrates.
Now I must leave, Meno, I have an appointment at the courthouse.***
