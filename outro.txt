We wrote the entire dialogue using special annotations. For example, "Meno: [Yes|Correct]." means that Meno could say "Yes" or "Correct". A computer program was used to systematically flatten the annotated dialogue in such a way as to encode Meno's program. The number of ways a block of text can be so obtained grows exponentially with the number of such annotations. For example, "Meno: [Yes|Indeed], [Socrates|friend]" can be flattened in 4 ways, and "Socrates: [Isn't that|Is that not] [right|correct], [Meno|friend]?" can be flattened in 8 ways. Thus the problem is more feasible than it might initially seem.

The annotated dialogue, and all associated computer programs, are available at URL. The dialogue includes nested annotations. For example, "Socrates: [I [suppose|reckon] you mean|You mean[,]] when I [told you|argued|suggested] that learning is really [just|just the same as|no different than] remembering?" This can be flattened in (2+2)*3*3=36 ways. We speculate that human memory, at some level, might resemble such annotated text. We generally do not remember conversations verbatim, but we're more likely to remember things like "My friend greeted me," "I greeted my friend back," which can be used to paraphrase past conversations.

As an application, a variation of this technique could theoretically be used to translate poetry while preserving rhyme and metre. We speculate perhaps similar methods were used for example by John Dryden, whose English translation of Virgil's Aeneid rhymes almost every line.

The idea of trying to write on water is attributed by Augustine (in his City of God) to an oracle of Apollo, via Porphyry. Socrates' bugging, bulging eyes recall the Theaetetus (143E), see also (...). That our eyes are like men talking to us recalls the Alcibiades 1 (132D). The intelligible and sensuous worlds are of course ubiquitous in Plotinus.
