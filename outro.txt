One moral we might draw from this story is that the statement ``philosophy will help me remember future contingent facts even if I try to contradict them'' could itself be contingent. Meno's paradoxical challenge initially seems to disprove this statement by pure reasoning (like the geometry example in Plato's \emph{Meno}), which would make the statement universally false. Socrates' victory
disproves that disproof.

We wrote the dialogue using annotations. For example, ``Meno: [Yes|Correct]'' means that Meno could say ``Yes'' or ``Correct''. A computer program flattened these annotations to encode Meno's program. The ways a passage can be so obtained grow exponentially with the number of annotations. ``Meno: [Yes|Indeed], [Socrates|friend]'' can be flattened in 4 ways; ``Socrates: [Isn't that|Is that not] [right|correct], [Meno|friend]?'' can be flattened in 8 ways. Thus the problem is easier than it initially appears. The annotated dialogue, and associated computer programs, are available at \url{https://github.com/semitrivial/Meno}.

As an application, a variation of this technique could theoretically be used to assist in the problem of preserving rhyme and metre when translating poetry. We speculate perhaps similar methods were used (without computer assistance) for example by John Dryden, whose English translation of Virgil's Aeneid rhymes almost every line.
