In the Meno, Plato's Socrates suggests the principle of anamnesis: there is no learning, only the remembering of forgotten knowledge. Presumably this should not be understood of contingent facts, or rather, perhaps we never truly know contingent facts: thus, Wittgenstein refused to acknowledge that there is no rhinoceros in the room. But it is fun to speculate about what would be implied if anamnesis did extend to contingent facts. It would extend to Plato's speakers' knowledge of their own words: they would know (but have forgotten) the very words they say, before saying them.

We designed a Socratic dialogue in which Meno asks for assistance remembering what he will say in the dialogue. Against all odds, Socrates succeeds. The dialogue takes place in a universe where Socrates and Meno know computer programming; Socrates uses techniques similar to quines (self-printing computer programs) and obfuscated code to evade Meno's paradox. Because of the venue's wordcount limit, we give here key excerpts (roughly 2500 words) of the roughly 7500 word dialogue. The full dialogue is available at \url{https://github.com/semitrivial/Meno}. In the climax, Socrates leads Meno to decode a computer program steganographically hidden in the words of the dialogue; skeptical readers can verify this computation using the full dialogue at the above link (either from scratch, or with the assistance of a verification script available at the same link). After these excerpts, we remark about how the dialogue was engineered.
