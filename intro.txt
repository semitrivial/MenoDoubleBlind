In the Meno, Platoâ€™s Socrates suggests the principle of anamnesis: there is no learning, only the remembering of forgotten knowledge. Presumably this should not be understood of contingent facts, or rather, perhaps we never really know contingent facts: thus, Wittgenstein refused to acknowledge that there is no rhinoceros in the room. But it is fun to speculate about implications if anamnesis did extend to contingent facts. It would extend to Plato's speakers' knowledge of their own words: they would know (but have forgotten) the very words they say, before saying them.

We designed a Socratic dialogue in which Meno asks for assistance remembering what he will say in the dialogue. He claims this is impossible, lest he could immediately say the opposite of whatever he was supposedly just about to say next. This dialogue takes place in a universe where Socrates and Meno knew computer programming; Socrates uses this to evade the paradox. We give here the key excerpts (roughly 2500 words) of the dialogue (roughly 7500 words). The full dialogue is available at URL. After these excerpts, we will remarks about how the dialogue was engineered.
